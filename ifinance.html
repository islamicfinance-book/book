                <h2>Intro to Islamic Finance</h2>
                <p>
                  The objective of this book is to close the gaps between conventional finance, cryptocurrency technology, and Islamic finance. If you've been reading through it, chances are good that you have heard of Islamic finance before in other contexts and would like to know more about it, and how it applies in the cryptocurrency marketplace. For a full picture, it's necessary to give a baseline knowledge of Islamic finance as it's practiced today. This book cannot be authoritative on the matter, and I encourage you to read more through various sources.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There's also a glossary of key terms at: http://www.islamic-banking.com/glossary_of_key_terms.aspx IF background https://twitter.com/OneJamaa/status/1122027414878449664
                </p>
                <p>
                  The fundamental distinction of IF is that riba (interest), gh? (speculation), and non-halal businesses (pork, alcohol) are forbidden. They are not simply words to be circumvented through similar systems, but antithetical to a fair and deterministic contract in IF. This system does not interfere with a business from having revenues and losses and profits, but the larger-scale mechanics of capitalism. How can an economy without interest encourage investment and money-lending, and how does it account for the opportunity cost of that investment
                </p>
                <p>
                  Virtually every deeper topic within IF can be traced back to this challenge of incentivizing capital development and investment, without relying on interest and speculation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Categories of contracts include: - takaful (insurance) - sukuk (bonds) - istana (farming) - qard al hassan and more etc. etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For individuals and microfinance-scale loans, the Islamic bank is tasked with building a contract which can be repaid on time, even though it is forbidden to add fees for late payments. This means that each loan is
                  based on trust -Â  an irresponsible borrower will not be allowed to continue borrowing. Building that trust over the internet requires a strong identity system, to prevent the borrower from buying a new SIM card or re-installing an app and applying for another loan.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For investments in larger businesses, incentives can be formed from profit-sharing. This is a common mudarabah / musharakah agreement.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On the national scale, sukuk has been used much the same as bonds in other countries. The country tends to give the investors a stake on natural resources or a new infrastructure development (tied to the reasons for collecting the sukuk).
                </p>
                <p>
                  These methods have been applied in newer economic practices, including crowdfunding: crowdfunding https://www.digitalnewsasia.com/digital-economy/ethis-ventures-receives-malaysias-first-islamic-ecf-license It is inevitable that cryptocurrency applications will appear and become popularized as well. https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/axmq5v/under_islamic_law_any_type_of_interest_is/
                </p>

                <a name="risk"></a>
                <h3>Sharia Risk</h3>
                <p>
                  In any investment, lenders map out the risks and categorize them. For example when buying a house, you assume the risk of the house being damaged in a flood, or on a macro-scale, the housing market suffering and being unable to profitable resell.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Islamic finance investments are endorsed by an expert, but still carry the so-called Sharia risk of being later discredited by an Islamic finance leader, either from a skeptical business partner, or through new government regulation. Some practices are considered halal in one country but not another, on the basis of Sharia interpretations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Fearing new regulation is nothing new in the conventional finance world, but the added uncertainty and inflexibility of a religious-based regulation makes institutions less likely to innovate or experiment with new structures. It might be prudent for a cryptocurrency program to re-implement existing structures (or improve on them in marginal ways), rather than marketing an untested system like the DAO, or a custom currency.
                </p>

                <a name="regulation"></a>
                <h3>Role of Government Regulation</h3>
                <p>
                  A consistently looming presence in the IF and cryptocurrency worlds is the political machine which regulates it. The countries which do and don't have IF banks is not determined by whether there are Muslim communities, but by those governments' willingness to review financial regulations (such as cash supply) and to cede some financial authority to Muslim leaders.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Indonesia, the most populous M country in the world, is only beginning to make governmental policies around IF.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In India, the (national legislature? RBI?) has repeatedly denied to create an I bank or I windowÂ  (Nov 2017) https://www.dailyo.in/business/islamic-banking-reserve-bank-of-india-raghuram-rajan-subramanian-swamy-muslim-law/story/1/20560.html though some have been created in Kerala state.

It may be that there is a global correlation between countries that distance themselves from new technologies and IF.
                </p>
                <h4>China</h4>
                <p>
                  The Chinese government has banned crypto exchanges, though other platforms continue to be built and focus on the blockchain technology. Recently a university in China began a program in Islamic finance studies; these are becoming more popular.

                Japan https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/MUFG-prepares-to-offer-Islamic-bonds-in-Japan UAE Dubai is well-known for having tech incubators (including for blockchain).

Venezuela, Iran, and Cuba
                <p>
                  As longtime targets of US sanctions, Venezuela, Iran, and Cuba have a particularly strange background on cryptocurrency and conventional finance. In the past few years, each country has announced serious interest in developing their own cryptocurrency, with Venezuela releasing the Petro based on national oil wealth. Cross-border advocates for Dash and other cryptocurrencies describe this as a factor in raising awareness and getting more ordinary people involved in cryptocurrency. For people who bought into Bitcoin as a privacy coin free of government manipulation, it may seem strange to see more totalitarian regimes making their own cryptocurrencies. There is a risk that some will deanonymize and use the national blockchain against opponents.

                <h3>Islamic Microfinance</h3>
                <p>
                  Microfinance is an emerging topic in the IF world. Many developing nations have practicing Muslim populations and communities, and the benefits of microfinance-scale loans has been researched intensively for decades now. According to Gates Foundation research in Pakistan and Bangladesh, one obstacle toward scaling up microfinance was that the practices were based on lending and high interest rates, which potential recipients rejected as not halal. Gates Fdn expert https://twitter.com/mapmeld/status/873570227178545152
                </p>
                <p>
                  The microfinance community must meet this challenge by innovating on their practices and experimenting with different IF contracts. This may be a potential inroad for cryptocurrency because the blockchain can enable payments across borders, serve as a bank account, and add transparency to donor/investor portfolios.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the direct funding world there are now concepts called
                  "nanofinance" where outside investors will help with even small improving purchases. ânanofinanceâ https://medium.com/world-economic-forum/move-over-microfinance-heres-why-the-future-of-development-is-in-nanofinance-fa8804499ee8 These could be financed by individuals on the blockchain, either within a community or halfway around the world (similar to how someone could trace coffee beans to the source).
