                <h2>Basics</h2>
                <p>
                  Let's get to the point. What do I mean by cryptocurrency? Is that the same as Bitcoin?
                  Has it been explored in Islamic finance?
                </p>
                <h4>What is a cryptocurrency?</h4>
                <p>
                  For a long time there have been currencies, usually issued by a country, kingdom, bank,
                  or company large enough to be the center of the local economy. Economists and
                  scholars have lived and died arguing the details of what makes currencies work, why some
                  currencies outperform others, and whether our current prevailing system
                  encourages future development.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A cryptocurrency uses proven math to provide users with an unforge-able, cryptographic key. That
                  key allows you to prove ownership of the account and sign payments, which can easily be verified
                  by other users. Not every cryptocurrency works exactly the same way, but in Bitcoin there is a
                  decentralized system (no single leader or technical failure point), and there is a fixed limit
                  to how much Bitcoin will ever be 'mined' and distributed (21 million).

                  What is your learning style? Would you prefer to listen to an explanation of cryptocurrency?
                  <br/>
                  Listen to investment management company co-founder Linda Xie on the A16Z podcast:
                  <a href="https://a16z.com/2018/05/04/intro-to-crypto/">'Intro to Crypto'</a>
                </blockquote>

                <h4>What makes cryptocurrency so different from traditional currencies?</h4>
                <p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>It's possible to quickly send payments to anyone in the world, for a small fee.</li>
                    <li>The currency supply is determined by programming, not people.</li>
                    <li>You can use free/libre software to create a key and 'be your own bank', without going to one official website, app, or company.</li>
                  </ul>
                  The supply of Bitcoin has a hard limit and is deflationary - as the economy expands, demand increases, and mining rewards shrink, each coin will increase in value.
                  Monetary policy varies for other cryptocurrencies, but its settings are usually programmed in from the start.
                </p>

                <h4>Can Islamic finance accept a digital currency?</h4>
                <p>
                  Multiple cryptocurrencies and some exchanges have sought out and received official Sharia approval.
                  What's the rationale for accepting cryptocurrencies - or any digital payments at all?
                </p>
                <p>
                  In <a href="http://dailyanarchist.com/2013/01/30/is-bitcoin-sharia-compliant/">a post by Davi Barker</a> in January 2013,
                  the earliest Shariah analysis I could find on Bitcoin:
                  <blockquote>
                    Imran Hosein identifies six traits common to all of these that amount to a definition of money in Islam.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Money is either precious metals or food.</li>
                      <li>Money is abundant and freely available.</li>
                      <li>Money is durable and does not spoil or corrode.</li>
                      <li>Money has intrinsic value.</li>
                      <li>Money exists in creation and is made valuable by God.</li>
                      <li>Money functions as a medium exchange.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </blockquote>
                  Digital currencies were, of course, not anticipated by early religious scholars.
                  What is the reasoning behind limiting currencies to precious metals, and avoiding
                  more common resources?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Barker continues:
                  <blockquote>
                    His objection to sand and paper is not that they are not metal or food, but that
                    they have no intrinsic value... [value must be] determined by supply and demand,
                    and not artificially assigned by central planners.
                  </blockquote>
                  A digital currency such as Bitcoin, which derives its value from a limited supply,
                  energy acquisition costs, and global acceptance, can hold the digital equivalent of the gold standard.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Later in 2013, <a href="https://cryptoinsider.com/cryptocurrency-islamic-financial-markets/">CryptoInsider reported</a>
                  a warning from Professor Ahamed Kameel Mydin Meera, that any digital currency must be backed by a traditional currency:
                  <blockquote>
                    For a digital currency to be accepted by Islamic Finance, it needs to have a measure of value, necessarily
                    the measure of value has to be a monetary commodity. You have to put a standard weight on paper notes or electronic
                    currencies to be accepted.
                  </blockquote>
                  By "standard weight" the professor is referring to a gold dinar, based on coins that circulated in early Islamic history.
                  Entrepreneurs inspired by this argument have made at least two Sharia-compliant
                  currencies based on the price of gold (<i>see more in the Stablecoins section</i>).
                </p>

                <h4>A short history of Sharia rulings on cryptocurrency</h4>
                <p>
                  Bitcoin and Bitcoin exchanges have received approving Sharia rulings from some scholars. I've also seen papers approving Ripple and Stellar.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At least two conservatively halal entrepreneurs in Dubai and Malaysia have created cryptocurrencies tied to the price of gold (see later section on stablecoins). Also the recipient of a halal ruling is X8, a Swiss company which issues tokens based on several national currencies (essentially a stablecoin).
 https://cointelegraph.com/news/swiss-crypto-firm-gets-islamic-finance-certification-for-sharia-compliant-stablecoin
                </p>
                <h5>Should we create a halal cryptocurrency or 'fork'?</h5>
                <p>
                  The first step would be to define what makes a cryptocurrency halal. Is Bitcoin enough? Is there a necessary change to how the cryptocurrency is mined, valued (as in the stablecoins), or spent?
                </p>
                <p>
                  If the change is that the currency is issued and regulated by a company or national bank, this move will likely be seen as a method to control people's savings and transactions. Naturally people are reluctant to lose control by switching currencies. The Venezuelan 'petro' was seen as such a move and only led to awareness of Bitcoin and other unmonitored cryptocurrencies. Facebook's development of a foundation for Libra has raised skepticism as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If the idea is to create a currency which only an in-crowd knows about and uses (local Basque currencies, Disney dollars), there is a historical precedent for this interesting and motivating people. It would make sense to issue this as a new cryptocurrency or token (more on tokens later) or fork. If it were a fork of a popular cryptocurrency, then everyone who holds their own Bitcoin keys would already have some of the currency, they just need to be made aware of it. (If someone holds Bitcoin through a managed bank or exchange such as Coinbase, they won't have direct access). Dr. Sami Al-Suwailem suggesting cryptocurrency loans derived from taxing wealth (demurrage, or Gesell tax)
                  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demurrage_(currency) . In a conventional cash economy, consumers might avoid putting cash into banks to avoid having their wealth measured. In a public blockchain, all balances are public, so holding wealth or transactions could be taxed as part of the structure of the currency. For details this was published in the Maldivian Islamic Finance magazine Laaba .
                </p>
                <p>
                  It would be difficult to restrict who can receive cryptocurrency as payment. If a market is completely closed, it might make more sense to use a centralized app. In a decentralized market, you might have only one official source to exchange the currency for 'real' cash or cryptocurrency, but as long as it has value there are chances that others will accept it as payment or exchange it for money.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Two current examples of payment restrictions are halal credit cards (which cannot be spent on alcohol) and WIC "food stamps" in the US which are restricted in complex ways (famously you can spend WIC at Subway unless your sandwich is toasted). But it is known that WIC has a secondary market where people sell their food credit at a discount for disallowed products.
                </p>

                <h4>How does cryptography protect a currency?</h4>
                <p>
                  When you use a credit card, both sides trust that their bank is debiting and crediting the right accounts.
                  That trust takes a great deal of technical, organizational, and regulatory work by the bank, and when that trust fails, people
                  resort to less convenient but more immediately transferable options, such as cash, gold, or trade.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Cryptocurrency is an attempt to combine the immediate transferability of cash in your pocket, with the security and precision
                  of the modern digital world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In fact cryptocurrency can make more secure payments by advancements in public-key cryptography.
                  Each user has a keypair with one private key (kept secret) and one public key (shared publicly) which are closely related.
                  Alice can 'sign' a message with her private key, and anyone can verify Alice's signature with her public key.
                  Alice may have a password protecting her private key, but the private key itself provides security
                  (2^xxx chance of guessing). Both sides can use the data in the transfer to verify it for themselves and see it
                  permanently recorded in the blockchain.
