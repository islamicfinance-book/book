                  <h1>Cryptocurrency in Islamic Finance</h1>
                  <h3>Is Bitcoin halal? And other conceptual questions in crypto-economics</h3>
                  <p>
                    This book is written for:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Islamic finance professionals, investors, and customers with an interest in blockchain and cryptocurrency
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        technologists new to Islamic finance (for a closer look, I recommend additional resources)
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>

                  <h4>A New Kind of Contract</h4>
                  <p>
                    Bitcoin and the blockchain have kickstarted a new industry.
                    At its core is math and cryptography which are tested, proven, and can run on any
                    device without depending on any one app, bank, or government.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Islamic finance has developed a set of standard contracts comparable to
                    conventional finance, especially since a resurgence in the 1970s. Regulatory
                    approval and enthusiasm for Islamic finance varies between countries, so these
                    banks do not cover all Muslims, nor are they limited to Muslim customers.
                    The key distinction is a ban on interest, and investors getting their
                    returns through equity, bonds, profit-sharing, or fees defined by contract.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    To outsiders, cryptocurrency may seem like a runaway train that enriches a few
                    and scams others, and Islamic finance may appear as a conservative movement with
                    a focus on tradition. You may be wondering: how can these polar opposites come together?
                    But as the Islamic finance industry grows, it has embraced entrepreneurs and innovators
                    to help with modernization.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I believe that there is unrealized potential for Islamic finance on the blockchain:
                    <ul>
                      <li>to automate processes, reducing overhead and fees</li>
                      <li>to make accounting and contract-management transparent to investors</li>
                      <li>to operate globally, reaching populations who are unbanked or without Islamic financial services</li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>
                  <h4>References</h4>
                  <p>
                    Whenever quoting a source, and when possible on other factual points, I provide a link as a reference.
                    Over time, these sources may go offline, or otherwise become outdated.

                    I do not endorse or research every political and economic view of my sources, but cite them as early
                    and/or influential sources on Islamic finance and cryptocurrency.
