                <h3>Stablecoins</h3>
                <p>
                  Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency or token with trading value pegged to the dollar, Euro, Chinese yuan, another currency, or gold. Typically a stablecoin company will provide proof that it has millions (in cash or crypto) deposited or invested, and issue an equivalent amount of money in coins or tokens. It would be silly to spend more than $1 on a USD stablecoin or sell it for less than $1 when the original company will match the price.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In practice, the value of stablecoins can fluctuate a few percentage points, and companies have more complex plans than 1:1 deposits. MakerDAO has a system to loan out money from its reserves, which led to runaway interest rates.
                </p>

                <h4>Who benefits from a stablecoin?</h4>
                <p>
                  One of the leading arguments against investing in cryptocurrency in conventional and Islamic finance is that the market is too volatile.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With a reliable stablecoin, you know that your savings will maintain value, and businesses can set prices, accept purchases, and conduct business with the benefits of digital payments and without the instability.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In a HackerNoon post, Haseeb Qureshi calls developing a stablecoin “the Holy Grail of the cryptocurrency ecosystem”: Stablecoins: designing a price-stable cryptocurrency
                </p>
                <p>
                  A USD or Chinese Yuan stablecoin may appeal to investors whose local currency is declining in value, or where they cannot easily open a bank account to store personal earnings and savings in USD.

                <h4>Not just printing money</h4>
                <p>
                  Strategies for launching a trustworthy stablecoin revolve around technical, legal, or organizational methods to build trust in the founders keeping “real money” in their reserves:

                <p>
                  TrustToken, the creator of TrueUSD, writes:
                  <blockquote>
                    we’ve partnered with professional third-party fiduciaries and banks, who manage access to the escrow account that holds the US dollars backing the tokens. As a TrueUSD token holder, you can redeem your TrueUSD tokens for US dollars…[you] exchange USD directly with an escrow account — we never touch the funds…
                  </blockquote>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Basis/Basecoin writes:
                  <blockquote>
                    a price-stable cryptocurrency with an algorithmic central bank… when demand is rising, the blockchain will create
                    more Basis. The expanded supply is designed to bring the Basis price back down. When demand is falling, the blockchain will buy back Basis. The contracted supply is designed to restore Basis price.

                  Tether is currently under US CFTC investigation and recently discontinued working with their auditor, but according to their site and an FSS report:
                  <blockquote>
                    Every tether is always backed 1-to-1, by traditional currency held in our reserves
                  </blockquote>

                <p>
                  bitCNY and bitUSD store another cryptocurrency as their collateral:
                  <blockquote>
                    bitUSD is an asset that is not backed by real dollar in someone’s bank account. The reasons for this is trust. We cannot trust anyone to hold and secure a physical asset so that people can redeem it eventually…
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    … behind any bitUSD, there are x amount of BTS that cannot be touched, traded or otherwise moved. These BTS are locked in a smart contract and serve as collateral.

                  MakerDAO’s Dai works as a type of loan against Ethereum holdings:
                  <blockquote>
                    when Dai is worth over $1 USD, ETH holders are incentivized to create more Dai and sell it, as it’s free money.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    When Dai is worth less than $1 USD, [collateralized debt position] owners can pay down their debt at a cheaper price! source

                  In 2018, Y-Combinator backed the AnchorUSD stablecoin:
                  <blockquote>
                    Secure Escrow: All funds are stored in an escrow account, for the sole purpose of allowing redemption by holders. Verified Funds: We work with public accounting firms to publish regular audits of our reserves.
                  </blockquote>
