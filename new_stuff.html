                <h3>Stablecoins</h3>
                <p>
                  Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency or token with trading value pegged to the dollar, Euro, Chinese yuan, another currency, or gold. Typically a stablecoin company will provide proof that it has millions (in cash or crypto) deposited or invested, and issue an equivalent amount of money in coins or tokens. It would be silly to spend more than $1 on a USD stablecoin or sell it for less than $1 when the original company will match the price.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In practice, the value of stablecoins can fluctuate a few percentage points, and companies have more complex plans than 1:1 deposits. MakerDAO has a system to loan out money from its reserves, which led to runaway interest rates.
                </p>

                <h4>Who benefits from a stablecoin?</h4>
                <p>
                  One of the leading arguments against investing in cryptocurrency in conventional and Islamic finance is that the market is too volatile.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With a reliable stablecoin, you know that your savings will maintain value, and businesses can set prices, accept purchases, and conduct business with the benefits of digital payments and without the instability.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In a HackerNoon post, Haseeb Qureshi calls developing a stablecoin “the Holy Grail of the cryptocurrency ecosystem”: Stablecoins: designing a price-stable cryptocurrency
                </p>
                <p>
                  A USD or Chinese Yuan stablecoin may appeal to investors whose local currency is declining in value, or where they cannot easily open a bank account to store personal earnings and savings in USD.
                </p>

                <h4>Not just printing money</h4>
                <p>
                  Strategies for launching a trustworthy stablecoin revolve around technical, legal, or organizational methods to build trust in the founders keeping “real money” in their reserves:
                </p>
                <p>
                  TrustToken, the creator of TrueUSD, writes:
                  <blockquote>
                    we’ve partnered with professional third-party fiduciaries and banks, who manage access to the escrow account that holds the US dollars backing the tokens. As a TrueUSD token holder, you can redeem your TrueUSD tokens for US dollars…[you] exchange USD directly with an escrow account — we never touch the funds…
                  </blockquote>

                <p>
                  Basis/Basecoin writes:
                  <blockquote>
                    a price-stable cryptocurrency with an algorithmic central bank… when demand is rising, the blockchain will create
                    more Basis. The expanded supply is designed to bring the Basis price back down. When demand is falling, the blockchain will buy back Basis. The contracted supply is designed to restore Basis price.

                  Tether is currently under US CFTC investigation and recently discontinued working with their auditor, but according to their site and an FSS report:
                  <blockquote>
                    Every tether is always backed 1-to-1, by traditional currency held in our reserves
                  </blockquote>
                </p>
                <p>
                  bitCNY and bitUSD store another cryptocurrency as their collateral:
                  <blockquote>
                    bitUSD is an asset that is not backed by real dollar in someone’s bank account. The reasons for this is trust. We cannot trust anyone to hold and secure a physical asset so that people can redeem it eventually…
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    … behind any bitUSD, there are x amount of BTS that cannot be touched, traded or otherwise moved. These BTS are locked in a smart contract and serve as collateral.
                  </blockquote>
                </p>
                <p>
                  MakerDAO’s Dai works as a type of loan against Ethereum holdings:
                  <blockquote>
                    when Dai is worth over $1 USD, ETH holders are incentivized to create more Dai and sell it, as it’s free money.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    When Dai is worth less than $1 USD, [collateralized debt position] owners can pay down their debt at a cheaper price! source

                  In 2018, Y-Combinator backed the AnchorUSD stablecoin:
                  <blockquote>
                    Secure Escrow: All funds are stored in an escrow account, for the sole purpose of allowing redemption by holders. Verified Funds: We work with public accounting firms to publish regular audits of our reserves.
                  </blockquote>
                </p>

                <h4>Stablecoins for every country</h4>
                <p>
                  Cryptocurrency is no longer a lawless “wild west”. Stablecoin founders with collateral in the bank must have lawyers and business plans and headquarters in countries with financial regulations. Governments have been known to set exchange rates, ban exporting their currency, and shut down private exchanges. Cryptocurrency code may keep on running, but if the founders lose access to their bank account, or you can no longer sell your tokens for another currency, then the stability is no longer valid, and the price will collapse.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The United States and China are not particularly friendly to cryptocurrency, but their financial and legal systems are stable and documented well enough that founders and investors are convinced that the reward is worth the risk. As cryptocurrency use spreads, maybe we will see other countries’ currencies?
                </p>

                <h4>Potential benefits for Stablecoins in Islamic Finance</h4>
                <p>
                  The rules of Islamic finance warn investors against uninformed contracts and speculation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It’s possible that awareness of stablecoins could convince  skeptics to re-evaluate cryptocurrency as a whole. People living in countries with unreliable currencies and banks could store savings in US dollars (or rials or dirhams or dinars or rupiyah… if their countries will allow local innovation). There is no interest/riba on the account, as would be applied by a conventional-finance bank. Remittance fees and currency controls could be eliminated by smart contracts. It’s possible for this to happen with fairness and transparency and without jumping onto the Bitcoin roller coaster.
                </p>

                <h4>Taxation</h4>
                <p>
                  In Laaba, an Islamic finance publication in the Maldives, the author calls for blockchain technology to allow taxing wealth. Although taxing wealth is an old theory, it is often impractical for people to find and calculate sums from various accounts, and the wealthy may use tax shelters and (dummy) corporate accounts to hide wealth. In a blockchain with this enabled, every account could receive a flat tax automatically deducted and sent to the contributors, or it could be send in every mined block (similar to the founders' fee in ZCash).

                <h3>The Lightning Network</h3>
                <p>
                  Frustrated by Bitcoin's high fees and slow transaction times, years of effort have been spent on programming a new 'secondary layer' of payment for Bitcoin, known as the Lightning Network. A user opens a channel with a store and can send money back and forth across the channel for minimal cost.
                </p>

                <h4>A new channel for micropayments</h4>
                <p>
                  In Bitcoin’s early days, entrepreneurs jumped at the opportunity to make quick transfers with low fees. As the price of Bitcoin has risen, that small fractional fee has become a higher price. In 2017, proposals to solve this problem forked each Bitcoin into two coins and two rival communities: Bitcoin Core (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). Bitcoin Core fully adopted a proposal called SegWit early this year, and is now moving on to incorporating the
                  Lightning Network. Fees have gone down, but remain too high for micropayments to be financially viable.
                </p>
                <h4>Bitcoin's micropayments problem</h4>
                <p>
                  Just as one dollar can be divided into 100 cents, a Bitcoin can be divided into 100 million “satoshis”. Even at Bitcoin’s peak, $20k, it would take 50 satoshis to make one cent. To borrow a quote from Richard Feynman, “there’s plenty of room at the bottom.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  More than a few entrepreneurs have started talking about these small amounts of Bitcoin to change how payments work, offer video creators one cent per view, pay for school supplies in the developing world, etc. But in the blockchain, every transaction is copied onto thousands of computers, and it’s estimated that Bitcoin’s throughput is seven transactions per second. Spam payments less than a cent, called “dust”, could pollute that network. Nowadays, these transactions are ignored unless they provide a fee to miners. This delicate balance keeps small transactions expensive. For example, my wallet app refuses to send amounts less than 4 cents, and
                  apps charge 10 to 78 cents per transaction.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lightning Network made it possible for me to send multiple Bitcoin transactions smaller than a cent, almost instantaneously.
                </p>
                <h4>What is Lightning Network?</h4>
                <p>
                  In January 2016, the Lightning Network was introduced via a white paper post, as is tradition in the cryptocurrency world. By that summer, a payments startup asked me what I thought about the proposal. It would be January 2017 when Lightning reached an alpha release, and in March 2018 the protocol became available on Bitcoin and Litecoin networks. Now that there’s a boom in apps and users, I took the plunge and sent my first few cents via Lightning. It’s the best way for me to understand what this really is, and how it works inside of the Bitcoin ecosystem.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You connect with another peer in the Lightning Network, and open a tab, where both sides can move money back and forth, with transactions big and small. It’s
                  represented technically as a shared wallet where both sides share confirmations of transactions sent and received. When you’re done paying, you close the connection and use that information to send a final one-transaction summary to the Bitcoin blockchain.
                </p>
                <h4>Making payments</h4>
                <p>
                  Here’s how you pay someone in Lightning for the first time:
 Find an interesting Lightning-enabled site, such as Poketoshi, Lightning Spin (roulette wheel gambling), Bitcoin Plays (similar to Twitch Plays Pokemon), or Satoshi’s Place (anyone can draw anything; NSFW).
 Install an app which supports Lightning payments (on Android, I use this app from Anton Kumaigorodski which launched just this month).
Note that a testnet version of Anton’s app has been running since January.
 You transfer > $20 of Bitcoin into this wallet on your phone. “But I’m doing micropayments!” you say. It’s a little more complicated than that.
 Use the Lightning site’s prompts (for example, entering a command on Poketoshi) to open up a big QR code. The
 Lightning-enabled wallet can scan this and should ask to open up a payment channel between you and the site.
Anton’s app frequently tells me “Data loss protection is not provided by this peer” and refuses to connect, including on Satoshi’s Place and Bitcoin Plays.
 You pay a 3–5 cent fee to open your channel, and make sure some money is available in it (in Anton’s app, it’s 300,000 satoshi, currently $19.50).
</p>
                <p>
                  The channel needs three confirmations before it can be used. This took about 30 minutes :-\
 I requested a few button presses on Poketoshi and saw them appear in the live stream a second or so later.
 I closed the transaction and got my remaining deposit back (the way this is handled now is a little confusing… ideally we would mutually close the connection and have money back immediately, but I unilaterally closed, increasing the fee and
 making me wait 22 hours). Total cost: 300 Satoshi to play ($0.02) and 22,509 Satoshi in fees ($1.63).

                  OK, so I wouldn’t want to open and close a channel every time that I buy a candy bar. But suppose I kept channels open as a running tab with my grocery store, the gas station, the New York Times, and YouTube. I pay that same dollar fee once, and from then onward I can send any number of payments, big or small. No more credit card transaction fees! Services which have high enough sales could also cover these deposit and fees for their customers.

                <h4>Reducing number of channels</h4>

                  Here’s where it gets political: many users believe in Bitcoin as decentralized money, and there’s a fear that the next step for Lightning Network would be adoption by banks. My wallet would have only one channel to pay my bank, my grocer would have channels to their bank and their payroll, and our banks can continue to charge fees
                  and control transactions as intermediaries. It’s not clear if banks will ever be onboard (it is Bitcoin, after all) but personally I think it’s not likely to be 100% centralized or 100% decentralized.

                <h4>How does it compare to other micropayment strategies? </h4>
                <p>
                  I was thinking about the micropayments channel concept a bit more. Suppose I pay an arcade $50 and play games until I run out of credit. Is Lightning Network any better? I think it is, because I own and control my share of the money in the payment channel. I’m never stuck with tokens which I can’t cash in. There’s also transparency in how much money both sides have committed.

                  It’s also interesting to think about this for a bank providing financing to an entrepreneur, or a university providing grant funding. Creating the channel commits funds. The bank could divide a loan up into several small transactions, covering equipment, raw materials, and expenses, as these are documented for the account manager (human or AI). It’s unclear to me how possible it would be to withdraw and use money without
                  closing and re-opening the channel.

                <p>
                  It’s a little clunky to get started, but expect Lightning Network to continue evolving, lowering fees, and changing impressions of Bitcoin.

                  Snarks and JS https://twitter.com/nicolagreco/status/993968794589716480 ​zkSnarks are a type of smart contract introduced by ZCash and slowly being ​incorporated into Ethereum. Rather than a publicly interpretable contract with globlly known state, a snark uses homomorphic encryption for other apps to ​calculate its results, without knowing the unencryted meaning. At the moment, ​zk-Snarks are usually simple arithmetic problems, and their gas prices are significantly higher than a public contract, but there is interest in developing this technology further.
