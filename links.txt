    L.C.  + my own presentation - Mostly looking Into the possibilities of using bitcoin as a transparent payment option to counter local corruption and use blockchain tech to create migrant ids across countries. Some NGOs are issuing their own crypto currency to manage donations I think. They come with their pros and cons. It's all new to me and I need to look more into this. I'm planning on writing a blog post about it in a more comprehensive perspective and without the hypes. But I'm sure there are good articles out there already. Will let you know when that's done.

People have made money on "altcoins", but these have a tendency to rise and collapse without warning (similar to "penny stocks"), and are more easily manipulated by mining companies or larger investors.
