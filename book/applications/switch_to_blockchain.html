                <h2>Reasons for switching to a blockchain</h2>
                <p>
                  Even if you understand the capability of a cryptocurrency to make payments, and a blockchain to maintain information and smart contracts, you may be asking at this point, is it worth it? What proves that these technologies have a practical use that improves on conventional finance?
                </p>
                <p>
                  One thing to understand is that we can't expect blockchains to be perfect. When any system encounters the real world and real people, someone could enter false information into your system.Â  Once I met someone who worked on electronic seals for nuclear material. His philosophy was: there are ways that determined nation-states could break, reverse-engineer, or otherwise manipulate their way into breaking a seal. His goal was to make that process so untenable that a bad actor would either make that

                <h3>International payments</h3>
                <h4>Employment and remittances</h4>
                <p>
                  One of the largest factors in the economy worldwide is <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-money-moves-can-crypto-play-its-part-george-harrap/">remittances</a>:
                  payments from foreign workers to their home countries. It's also a big business: international banks, Western Union, and others charge a fee when transferring funds and exchanging currencies. There are legitimate reasons behind these fees, such as maintaining offices globally, and verifying identity of recipients.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As the rest of our economy has grown instantaneous and  digital, the traditional banking and wire transfer system often appears costly and time-consuming. Know Your Customer (KYC) laws and business decisions restrict who can receive money transfers and how much they can receive. Remote workers on platforms such as Fiver and UpWork may find it difficult to receive payments at a bank in their home country.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Cryptocurrencies do not know which country that you live in, and they don't need a bank account or identity check to be transferred.
                  The only limitation when traveling between countries is whether (a) you can get internet access, and (b) a local company or person is willing to accept that currency.
                </p>

                <h4>Safely crossing borders</h4>
                <p>
                  With cryptocurrency funds, you can cross a border and still access your funds in an app or on your phone. In Venezuela, people cross into Colombia with little cash on them, and then make purchases using
                  <a href="https://blog.dash.org/venezuelan-crypto-adoption-will-surpass-10-of-stores-in-2020-e972fe0b9871">Dash</a>,
                  <a href="https://twitter.com/StellarOrg/status/1158045932090380288">Stellar</a>, and other cryptocurrencies.

                </p>

                <h4>Payments in international tourism</h4>
                <p>
                  Platforms such as Airbnb are used to rent out rooms in homes and hotels around the world. After guests make their payments, platforms will wire that money to your bank account. I've personally experienced cases where hosts found it exceedingly difficult to share their local bank information with Airbnb. They are put into situations where they may have an account holding hundreds or thousands of dollars, but they are unable to access it without dealing with paperwork, routing numbers, and fees. Cryptocurrency is not commonly used today, but could become a new source of quick payment resolution.
                </p>

                <h4>Payments for online work</h4>
                <p>
                  Remote workers with one consistent job, or multiple jobs through Fiver and UpWork, can face a similar problem in receiving payments. Designers and computer
                  programmers in Afghanistan, for example, could be matched to these jobs and make good income on them, but are limited by government and corporate restrictions on transferring that money inside of the country.
 Platforms such as ETH Bounties now share technical, design, and translation jobs which will pay workers with cryptocurrency.
                  I once received a bounty payment on GitCoin for adding translation features to the MetaMask wallet, and issues a bounty for one of the first translations.
                  Through bounty hunters and volunteers' contributions, there are now dozens of translations for MetaMask.

                <h3>Transparent banks and currency</h3>
                <p>
                  In the United States, people are reluctant to move money out of a comparatively stable currency and banking system.
 Not every country is so lucky, and systemic failures have upended many an economy or inconvenienced investors (for example, devaluing higher-value bills in India). This is one of the reasons that USD-pegged stablecoins have been popular around the world: they allow private US dollar accounts in regions where that may be unavailable or heavily restricted.

  In this case, a bank collapsed, and destroyed confidence in other banks, because they would make huge, risky loans out to shareholders and end up losing the original
  deposits.

  In Argentina, up until 2017 the government <a href="https://milevalue.com/argentina-money-situation-2016-dollar-blue-credit-card-atm-bank-cash/">controlled the exchange rate and import/export of currencies</a>.

  <blockquote>
  While the middle class is being blocked by their banks and governments from merely holding and transferring money,
  for people at the bottom of the pyramid, itâs often impossible to get a business loan from a traditional bank.
  They might pay a banker to hold valuables (such as jewelry) which can then be withdrawn and sold in a crisis.
  Everyone makes use of mobile money solutions, which grew out of airtime.

  For people who read this situation as being a fault of Argentina's politics and banks,
  an investment in cryptocurrency is appealing,
  and adopting cryptocurrency completely is an intriguing option.

  The idea of making these systems fully decentralized, transparent, and potentially democratic
  is appealing in many countries.

                <h3>A Fresh and Halal Supply Chain</h3>
                <p>
                  In 2018, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/following-a-tuna-from-fiji-to-brooklynon-the-blockchain/">Wired Magazine profiled a startup</a>
                  (now known as <a href="https://treum.io/">Treum</a>) which tracks fish from where it's caught, to the restaurant where it's eaten.

                  All of the steps for the fish are logged in Ethereum's blockchain and made available to the customer. Treum also has a partnership with <a href="https://www.verifiedorganic.io">Verified Organic</a>,
                  which tracks the farming of fruits and vegetables.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In the halal food industry, <a href="https://salaamgateway.com/story/halalchain-halaltrail-healthfx-blockchain-iot-and-cryptocurrencies-for-halal-supply-chains-have-arri">multiple startups</a> based in
                  Dubai, UK, and Singapore track the origin / production of foods to halal-compliant producers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As consumers grow more conscious about their food being fresh, healthy, and organic, the demand grows for these traces. They also are demanding ethical conditions for farmers and fishmermen, and ethical treatment of animals (eggs from cage-free/free-range chickens). I'm aware of
                  human rights and sustainable sources becoming more sensitive issues in the halal industry as well. When these products appear on store shelves, we are willing to pay a premium for quality. How can you be sure that the seller is honest about its practices? No one likes to be conned.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The same problems affect companies which outsource their manufacturing to a network of unknown middlemen and suppliers. They need to know where products are delayed or stolen from the supply chain. A paper or digital record shown after the fact may be unreliable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A supply chain expert at the US Department of Commerce explained the value of verification to me with an example: refrigerated trucks keep products cold to the moment they arrive in your store freezers (cold chain). Dishonest drivers can save money by shutting off refrigeration during a long drive, and reactivating it before arriving. Adding tamper-proof temperature sensors to
                  shipments allowed companies to verify that their product was handled correctly and safely.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Blockchains are a similar opportunity to make a verifiable, uneditable, timestamped log of work on a product. Individuals, farms, fishing boats, and processing facilities can all use keys to sign when receiving and delivering the product. Additional ingenuity can print a code on the product label and use cryptographic hashes verify that it was seen at each step of the journey. Computerized databases and processes exist without a blockchain (for example, you may have tracked a package online) but these systems typically rely on movement inside one shipment company's network. Food companies have used mascots and marketing rather than show actual details to consumers. By logging each step in a tamper-proof decentralized blockchain, you can know that a fresh or halal product has the origins that you expect.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Each address on a blockchain is the fingerprint or hash of a cryptographic key. If that key can be relied on as a signature on payments, it can also be used to sign other messages. This allows the key to serve as your identity online. With a key stored securely in your phone or web browser, you could sign documents, log into websites without typing a password, or open an electronic door.

                <h3>Asset Ownership</h3>
                <p>
                  Islamic financial regulations differ between regions. In Malaysia, it is possible to sell commodities to an Islamic bank and gradually re-purchase them in a baiâ al âinah contract, with a likely profit for the bank. The commodity often relates to the customerâs use for the cash (as an example, lumber for a home loan).

                  It is essential that the commodities in the contract are real and assessed at their actual value. Using tokens archived on a blockchain, a bank could track their inventory, and prove the price for an asset (i.e. the lumber continues to sell at the stated price and hasnât rotted or otherwise depreciated).

                  Transparency is also possible without a blockchain, but internal IT and in-person visits could be replaced with one platform for sale, inventory, reporting, and
                  repayment.
                </p>

                <a name="identity"></a>
                <h3>Identity</h3>
                <p>
                  <a href="https://twitter.com/nlw/status/1171936892729876480">Using a key in a public blockchain for an identity system</a> would allow you to sign into several different services, without anyone controlling your sign-in credentials, or storing an email or password.Â  It would be technically possible on a private blockchain, but such a system might as well collect and store credentials in a different way.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As with many other credential systems, a weak point is resetting a lost password. If you lose the cryptographic key and any backups, there is no feasible way to recover that key (otherwise thieves would 'recover' keys for many accounts). In some systems, the only remedy is to start over with a new key and new account.

                  If you have some type of backup (SMS/text message, email, hardware token, ID verification) then the security of your app is dependent on that decision. If someone can access an account within minutes of receiving a text, that raises incentive for hackers to clone a SIM or steal
                  your phone number.Â  If your account has ID verification, alerts the user over existing contact information, and has a 24-hour waiting period, these make fraud more complex, and the chances are better for a real user to cancel the password reset.

                  You might want to use keys as ID on a site where people are often exchanging cryptocurrency or using smart contracts. Another use case would be a website for people who cannot register with an email or password, for privacy or memory reasons.

The refugees cannot be hired for conventional jobs without a visa, so the token offers a means to track and reward refugees' work in the refugee centers.

                <h3>Decentralized Storage</h3>
                <p>
                  Every Bitcoin transaction has a little bit of extra space where you can record information. Because the complete Bitcoin transaction history is stored in the blockchain, copies of these messages will be online as long as Bitcoin is remembered. Some cryptocurrency enthusiasts have stored their URLs and marriage proposals. Others have stored links to criminal content.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Ethereum blockchain has additional capabilities, as you might recall, and one option is storing additional data in the blockchain. The fees for storing your content on all Ethereum nodes forever are extremely high. It would not be cost-effective to store a Word doc, PDF, or photo on this blockchain. Anything more than a text message would be overpriced.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For more efficient and affordable storage, a growing decentralized file system is IPFS.
                </p>

                <h4>Storing Hashes</h4>
                <p>
                  Given the small space available in Bitcoin, the cost of storing data in the Ethereum blockchain, and the public readability of both blockchains, often an application will store only a hash value in the blockchain.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you aren't familiar with hash functions, here are a few things to know:
                  <ul>
                    <li>hash functions accept data and return a hash, which is sort of a fingerprint or patternâ¦ it is not accurate to say that it is a copy or compressed file, as it cannot be restored to the original content</li>
                    <li>hash functions work consistently - the hash of the same content at two times or two difference machines should always return the same value</li>
                    <li>if this is difficult to think about, imagine shrinking a high-res photo down to a 16-by-16 pixel stamp. You cannot restore those pixels back to the original photo, but identical photos will shrink down to the same pattern, and two different photos will look different</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                  One practical application of the hash function on the blockchain is <a href="https://proofofexistence.com/">Proof of Existence</a>.
                  Many an aspiring screenwriter claims that they showed a script around Hollywood, and then had their idea stolen, and a movie made without them. When you have this screenplay, photo, blueprint, or other file, Proof of Existence will make a SHA-256 hash of the document and store it in the blockchain for a small fee. No one can reverse the hash to read your document, but if years later you had to prove original authorship, you can point to this file, and the timestamped, uneditable hash in the blockchain as proof.
                  But how do others know that it's the same document? First, you can't sneak changes into the document. Even a small change in spacing or punctuation would change the SHA-256 hash value.
                  Though other binary data can resolve to the same hash, it's essentially impossible that this binary data would also be readable text or a coherent picture.
                  Some hash functions have been manipulated to create false matches (Google's SHA-1 research), but these matches have signs of manipulation, and SHA-256 is much more secure.
                </p>
                <h4>When can't we use hashes?</h4>
                <p>
                  Just because we can't reverse a hash doesn't mean that no one can guess the original value.
                  When New York City released data of 173 million taxi trips, the taxi's ID and driver's license ID were obfuscated with the MD5 hash, but making a list of possible taxi IDs made it simple to de-anonymize
                  <a href="https://tech.vijayp.ca/of-taxis-and-rainbows-f6bc289679a1?gi=e6c7be713b87">which taxi had which hash</a>.

                  After data is entered into the blockchain, it can't be removed. Be careful with privacy issues like this emerging. It's useless to hash personal details or combinations which are easy to guess (names, birthdays and other dates, license numbers, random numbers, dictionary words).

                  On a project years ago, I once suggested printing a QR code on a license, and storing a hash of {name, birthday, and a fingerprint of the original photo} on the blockchain. You couldn't reverse the hash without access to the original digital images or license, and at that  time you have the original information printed on the license, anyway. You couldn't forge a name or birthday on the license without invalidating the hash.

                <a name="tokens"></a>
                <h3>Tokens</h3>
                <h4>What's the difference between a coin, a contract, and a token?</h4>
                <p>
                  Coins such as Bitcoin and Ether are mined and distributed on the blockchain from the beginning of that project, as part of the source code of the blockchain and client application. Fees are paid to miners in that currency.

                  Contracts, as mentioned earlier in the book, are programs which are added to the blockchain and can process payments or share information automatically.

                  Tokens are created by a custom contract added to the blockchain, with the understanding that one user or organization controls and issues the supply.

                  In cases where you pay fees with a token, there is an intermediary who pays the fees in the original, base cryptocurrency.
                </p>
                <h4>MetaMask</h4>
                <p>
                  <a href="https://metamask.io/">MetaMask</a> is an Ethereum, tokens, and web3.js wallet which works as an extension in most browsers,
                  and is built into the Brave browser.
 Full disclosure: I have written internationalization and localization code for MetaMask. It's an open source project and is always welcoming new translations!

                </p>

                <h4>Gambling and Prediction Markets</h4>
                <p>
                  Cryptocurrency's ability to transfer money across borders and without legal restrictions, has appeal to online gambling sites. In Islamic finance, all forms of gambling  are termed maysir and not allowed.


                  Futures and prediction markets are less based on chance, and have been embraced by conventional finance as a way to signal market changes and 'bet against' the market. Similar markets have appeared
                  in the cryptocurrency world : Bitcoin futures to either bet for/against a rising Bitcoin price, and prediction markets such as Augur.

                  These markets work within conventional legal frameworks, have clearnet websites, corporate offices, etc. The decentralized nature of Augur makes it open for more people globally to host and bid on predictions. In some cases people have used the blockchain to post prediction
                  markets which are deemed too extreme or negative by others standards, such as predicting natural disasters or death of a public figure.

Are these markets acceptable in Islamic finance? The best that we can do is to look at whether their analogous concepts are accepted or rejected on the  Islamic stock markets.

In my research I found that BMB Islamic Bank (in the UK and Dubai) launched Islamic financial futures in 2008, and considered them to be a new Sharia-compliant product.
At the time of the article, a Bahraini company <a href="https://www.euromoney.com/article/b13226wd7ky70r/islamic-finance-shariah-compliant-futures-contract-set-to-launch-in-2008">was considering a standard</a> as well.

 In general, though, it appears conventional futures and prediction markets do not exist in the conventional Islamic finance markets.

                <h3>Corporate Decentralized Governance</h3>
                <p>
                  The DAO was created as a venture capital fund, but it was also notably designed to make funding decisions through shareholder votes. There was no human management in the smart contract between receiving proposals, collecting votes, and funding projects. This design inspired interest in 'autonomous corporations', which could operate online and potentially offline (for example, a fleet of self-driving taxis) without any human intervention. Regulations around businesses, consumer protections, and taxes could be circumvented by operating only in the blockchain.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Practically, smart contracts have an author or creator who would likely have legal and tax obligations. Offline this is more clear - a company that buys self-driving taxis and puts them on the road cannot pretend not to own or be responsible for them. What would be the legal basis?
                </p>

                <a name="collectibles"></a>
                <h3>Collectibles</h3>
                <p>
                  One common contract is <a href="http://erc721.org/">ERC-721</a> - otherwise known as the "collectibles" smart contract.
                  This is the basis of <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/dapper-labs-announces-flow-a-new-blockchain-by-the-creators-of-cryptokitties-300916636.html">CryptoKitties</a> and other platforms, which instead of trading identical/fungible tokens, share unique collectible items. You can think of these as digital trading cards.
 The advantage of creating a blockchain version over print or digital cards, is that only authentic trading cards can be used and exchanged.
  This contract is also used to authenticate artwork. A blockchain skeptic <a href="https://icoexaminer.com/ico-news/the-man-who-used-the-blockchain-to-lay-claim-to-the-mona-lisa/">registered an image of the Mona Lisa</a> as proof that one does not need to be the original author or artist to post. However, this is a fundamental misunderstanding.

                <a name="stablecoins"></a>
                <h3>Stablecoins</h3>
                <p>
                  Stablecoins are a form of cryptocurrency which is intended to stay fixed to the value of a national currency, basket of currencies, or gold. These can be implemented as tokens or on their own blockchain.

<a href="https://www.hellogold.com/">HelloGold</a>, <a href="https://onegram.org/">One Gram Coin</a>, and Swiss X8 have all been established as Sharia-compliant.

A common practice in the stablecoin world is to rely on third-party auditors or other methods to confirm that the stablecoin provider has money in reserve to back every coin that it issues.

Many stablecoins exist for the US dollar, with others covering the Chinese Yuan, and Euro. Several banks are reportedly researching stablecoins for their own use (though it's unclear what currency these would be pegged to).
