                <h2>Blockchain Skepticism</h2>

                <a name="practicality"></a>
                <h3>​Practicality</h3>
                <p>
                  The cryptocurrency world remains novel and inaccessible to most people worldwide when you take into account technical literacy, internet connectivity, language barriers, and
                  general awareness.
                  When travelers cross borders, it is ​much easier to find shops, banks, and traders who accept and exchange US dollars, Euros, Chinese Yuan, and other currencies,
                  compared to reliable local Bitcoin shops and exchanges. This is a natural downside of adopting a new technology based on network effects,
                  but it's notable that cryptocurrency has not taken root as a common tool of travelers in any country.
                </p>
                <p>
                  ​In countries where the local currency is unstable, cryptocurrency has helped many people protect their savings, but who has savings?
                  The <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/whats-holding-back-bitcoin-in-venezuela-this-group-is-investigating">Open Money Initiative</a>
                  and <a href="https://medium.com/givecrypto/98ea34dec1cc">GiveCrypto</a>
                  are ​researching how cryptocurrency is used in cross-border trade, remittances, and donations in Venezuela.
                  Realistically, only a minority of Venezuelans have adopted cryptocurrency. There are clear benefits to a few
                  people, but using or receiving crypto donations is not a panacea.
                </p>

                <a name="security"></a>
                <h3>Security and Theft</h3>
                <p>
                  ​The Bitcoin protocol has strong cryptographic security, but in practice most ​users depend on apps and exchanges to hold their cryptocurrency.
                  If I keep ​my money on an insecure or fraudulent exchange, it could be hacked and the ​money redirected elsewhere.
                </p>
                <p>
                  ​In the fiat world, many bank accounts are insured (in the US, FDIC).
                  Insurance is affordable because banks and financial crimes investigators can ​track where the money was sent, who received it, etc.
                  There are cases where sophisticated hackers succeeded (Bangladesh SWIFT) but overall there is a system of safety and accountability to the point that I don't expect a loss or interruption from hacks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One mitigation technique is to put Bitcoin into 'cold storage', with the keys to this 'cold wallet' kept offline or even in safety-deposit boxes.
                  Major exchanges will allow you to split ​and move cryptocurrency between the 'hot' and 'cold' wallets.
                  The 'cold wallet' ​system does not protect you from fraud, major flaws in the security system, or from a sophisticated hacker who convinces an exchange to release money from cold storage.
                  It's possible you could <a href="https://thenextweb.com/hardfork/2019/11/01/ceo-loses-private-key-crryptocurrency-exchange-wallet/">forget a password</a>
                  or use faulty software to <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/blockchain-bandit-ethereum-weak-private-keys/">generate weak keys</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  ​When a major exchange is hacked (for example, Mt. Gox), investors in and outside ​of that exchange suffer a loss of confidence, and the price of a currency may fall.
                </p>


                <h4>​Tainted Coins</h4>
                <p>
                  For years, one potential solution to the theft problem has inspired discussions about a public blocklist of stolen coins.
                  Theft and fraud would still be possible, but the thieves would find no safe harbor willing to take their money (without being blocked themselves).
                  On a less technical side, the early response to the DAO attack, Ethereum contacted many exchanges to block exchanging Ether for currency.
                </p>
                <p>​
                  The blockchain makes this level of tracing possible. In practice, we run into
                  <ul>
                    <li>tumblers: A modern form of money laundering - mixers on the dark web send your dirty money through tons of transactions and output money from other sources to your new address, minus a fee. This works only for smaller amounts of stolen currency, as a large amount (say 100ks to millions) would overwhelm the system and you'd be getting back the same coins that you put in.</li>
                    <li>unwitting accomplices: how would you feel if you received ​cryptocurrency fairly, and then were asked to prove that you didn't steal it? ​As money moves from address to address, it's usually not possible to say when ​it is being moved around by an individual, a mixer, or part of the regular economy.</li>
                    <li>centralization: the only way to give all individuals, exchanges, and apps a fair chance at blocking stolen coins, would be to create a centralized blocklist. This discussion runs opposed to most cryptocurrency early adopters, so a blocklist is highly controversial and potentially transformative for the crypto world. USDC has created and implemented a blocklist.</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>

                <h4>Quantum Safety</h4>
                <p>
                  A handful of companies are working on the first consumer-ready quantum computers.
                  With technical methods beyond the scope of this book, quantum computers can take advantage of natural physical effects to perform some calculations much faster than today's supercomputers ever could using transistors.
                  A universal quantum computer with thousands of entangled practical (not physical) qubits could break our most common encryption algorithms, including those used on the internet and in most cryptocurrencies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The current record as of this writing is still under 100 superconducting qubits, but the future is within sight.
                  Dr. Michele Mosca <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1075.pdf">estimated</a> a 1/7 chance of breaking RSA cryptography by 2026, and 1/2 chance by 2031.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For Bitcoin transactions, a high-powered quantum computer could use the public key signature used to verify an outgoing transaction, to find the private key used to sign that transaction.
                  This problem could be temporarily circumvented by always abandoning the old address after making a transaction (as discussed in blockchain transparency - sending your transaction and moving the change to a new address).
                  The oldest Bitcoin accounts (including Satoshi's) shared more information about their public keys, so these would be more vulnerable to quantum hackers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The post-quantum solution is still unclear (switching encryption algorithms? disabling keys from old accounts?).
                  The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is working towards a more clear global standard.
                  Several altcoins have adopted existing post-quantum algorithms as a selling point, but none are commonly used as of this writing.
                </p>

                <a name="attacks"></a>
                <h3>51% Attacks</h3>
                <p>
                  From the earlier section on Mining, you know that many different organizations and individuals are running cryptocurrency miners, and some are combining their efforts into 'mining pools'.
                  With small cryptocurrencies, and in rare cases with Bitcoin or others, a single user or pool may control the majority of mining computation power at one time.
                  If the 51%er is malicious, they could use their control to allow invalid transactions / double spending / or split the blockchain into two.

                  The website <a href="https://www.crypto51.app/">Crypto51.app</a> estimates the cost of a 51% attack on several blockchains.

                  In Bitcoin's case, estimate that computation of a 51% attack would be extremely expensive and would be detected.
                </p>

                <a name="energy"></a>
                <h3>​Energy costs</h3>
                <p>
                  Energy costs are mentioned in blockchain critism usually in three different contexts:
                  <ul>
                    <li>scalability: with the current network being relatively small, how can it scale up to support the global payment system?</li>
                    <li>environmentalism: energy consumption by cryptocurrency  miners may be seen as wasteful, and if it keeps increasing, may have a negative impact on the environment</li>
                    <li>cost: if Bitcoin consumes resources, how can it have value? This argument has puzzled for me for years. Golf courses consume huge resources in land and water, and we aren’t devaluing them, are we? I'd argue that energy consumption is one of the reasons why a digital currency has value, from scarcity.</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <h4>Statistics and solutions</h4>
                <p>
                  Over the past few years, the amount of energy used by cryptocurrency miners has gone from 'surprising' to 'maybe deeply affecting climate change'.
                  The University of Cambridge's Centre for Alternative Finance <a href="https://www.cbeci.org/">estimates the energy consumption</a> of Bitcoin in realtime.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At Bitcoin’s peak prices, reports following its exponential growth claimed that it was :
                  <blockquote>
                    By July 2019, the bitcoin network will require more electricity than the entire United States currently uses. By February 2020, it will use as much electricity as the entire world does today. — 
                    <a href="https://grist.org/article/bitcoin-could-cost-us-our-clean-energy-future/">grist.org/article/bitcoin-could-cost-us-our-clean-energy-future/</a>
                  </blockquote>
                  A later article claimed that Bitcoin mining had reversed the effects of energy efficiency movements across Europe.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As of this writing in July 2020, Bitcoin's energy consumption is not double that of the United States or the world.
                  This isn't due to a drop in interest, either - there are more miners with a higher hash rate than ever before.
                  The problem is estimating these energy costs.
                </p>
                <h4>Replacing Proof of Work</h4>
                <p>
                  Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies are considering shifting to “Proof of Stake” to replace “Proof of Work”, the basis of consensus in most public blockchains today.
                  The Ethereum FAQ page appeared in September 2016, and progress is coming along slowly.
                  Other projects use a related system, <a href="https://hackernoon.com/explain-delegated-proof-of-stake-like-im-5-888b2a74897d">Delegated Proof of Stake</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Luckily, Ethereum has clear founders and a relatively healthy process for accepting code changes.
                  Bitcoin has reacted bitterly in the past to technical disputes, and would likely need to fork again if changes were made to Proof of Work.

                <h4>Bitcoin for global clean energy</h4>
                <p>
                  One of the pro-Bitcoin takes which I’ve seen on this came from “Bitcoin and meat maximalist” and Nakamoto Institute president <a href="http://bitstein.org/blog/uncut-vice-interview-on-bitcoin-carnivory/">Michael Goldstein</a>,
                  who is more known for his quotes describing plants as “fiat food”.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Bitcoin mining will also incentivize an energy arms race, which will result in magnificent innovation in energy production, through nuclear power and other clean energies. Bitcoin miners do not want a single joule to go to waste.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Let’s see what he means by that (these are from separate but related Twitter threads also in late 2017).
                  These types of changes require huge capital investments, R&D, and construction time which take significant time.
                  As of July 2017, there were only two new nuclear power plants under construction in the United States:

                  So as interesting as this Bitcoin-backed pro-energy future might be, I don’t see how it can come quickly enough to offset near-future costs.

                <h4>Private Blockchains</h4>
                <p>
                  From another angle, IBM’s blockchain division <a href="https://twitter.com/SUST4IN/status/999192036535357440">acknowledges Bitcoin is unsustainable</a>, and appears to advocate for private blockchain solutions,
                  where you don’t have the competition and Proof of Work requirements of a public blockchain.

                <h3>Untrusted Contracts</h3>

                <h4>The DAO</h4>
                <p>
                  As mentioned earlier, the DAO was an experiment in crowdfunding for venture capital.
                  For many participants it was their first time using a smart contract, and the several steps toward adopting it were frustrating.
                  The DAO had a fatal flaw which allowed an outside contract (even though it hadn't been approved) to siphon money from the investment account.
                  This revealed that contracts work as they are programmed, not how we might want them to work.
                </p>

                <h4>Augur</h4>
                <p>
                  Augur is a prediction market which uses cryptocurrency and allows a variety of predictions (sports, politics, etc).
                  The blockchain has no way to verify the outcome of events in the real world, so the winning outcome is determined by a creator of the contract.
                  There are also concerns about a fully open prediction market being used to encourage or speculate on political violence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In one newsworthy case, a prediction market for 'who will control US congress after 2018 elections' initially posted that the Republican party still controlled the House the next day,
                  rather than the more rational reading (which party would win the elections and have control after inauguration of the newly elected Congress in January 2019).
                  This was disputed and resolved.
                </p>

                <p>
                  A potential solution is building a library of reliable code and components for contracts,
                  or making the code updateable in case of a failure. <a href="https://openzeppelin.com/contracts/">OpenZeppelin</a>
                  focuses on this use case.

                <h3>Stablecoins</h3>
                <p>
                  The most notable criticism of stablecoins that I've heard, is how governments have tried for many years trying to 'peg' their national currency to another, and every time they have failed.
                  With decentralization, it is always possible for third parties to open exchanges, and financiers will want to speculate and make a profit through arbitrage.
                  Are stablecoins capable of doing things differently?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another obvious critique of stablecoins is that they are unprofitable by design.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The benefit to Facebook or another org for opening up a stablecoin market, is the same reason that stores like to issue gift certificates or 'Disney dollars', and arcades convert your money into tokens
                  - they can receive standard money upfront, and know that users will continue to make purchases within their market.
                  Stablecoins could also safely introduce more customers and businesses to cryptocurrencies and token operations, calming fears
                  about technical security and volatility.
