                <h2>Basics</h2>
                <p>
                  Let's get to the point. What do I mean by cryptocurrency? Is that the same as Bitcoin?
                  Has it been explored in Islamic finance?
                </p>
                <a name="what"></a>
                <h4>What is a cryptocurrency?</h4>
                <p>
                  For a long time there have been currencies, usually issued by a country, kingdom, bank,
                  or company large enough to be the center of the local economy. Economists and
                  scholars have lived and died arguing the details of what makes currencies work, why some
                  currencies outperform others, and whether our current prevailing system
                  encourages future development.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A cryptocurrency uses proven math to provide users with an unforge-able, cryptographic key. That
                  key allows you to prove ownership of the account and sign payments, which can easily be verified
                  by other users. Not every cryptocurrency works exactly the same way, but in Bitcoin there is a
                  decentralized system (no single leader or technical failure point), and there is a fixed limit
                  to how much Bitcoin will ever be 'mined' and distributed (21 million).
                </p>

                  <br/>
                  Listen to Linda Xie on the A16Z podcast:

                <a name="different"></a>
                <h4>What makes cryptocurrency different from traditional currencies?</h4>
                <p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>It's possible to quickly send payments to anyone in the world for a small fee.</li>
                    <li>The security and currency supply is determined by programming.</li>
                    <li>You can use free/libre software to create a key and 'be your own bank', without going to one central website, app, bank, or government.</li>
                  </ul>
                  The supply of Bitcoin has a hard limit and is deflationary - as the economy expands, demand increases, and mining rewards shrink,
                  so each coin is expected to increase in value.
                  Monetary policy varies for other cryptocurrencies, but generally settings are defined in code from the start, so users
                  can decide whether the policies are favorable to them.

                <h3>A short history of Sharia rulings on cryptocurrency</h3>
                <h4>Can Islamic Finance accept a digital currency?</h4>
                <p>
                  Multiple cryptocurrencies and some exchanges have sought out and received official Sharia approval.
                  What's the rationale for accepting cryptocurrencies - or any digital payments at all?
                </p>
                <p>
                  In <a href="http://dailyanarchist.com/2013/01/30/is-bitcoin-sharia-compliant/">a post by Davi Barker</a> in January 2013,
                  the earliest Shariah analysis I could find on Bitcoin:
                  <blockquote>
                    Imran Hosein identifies six traits common to all of these that amount to a definition of money in Islam.
                    <ul>
                      <li>Money is either precious metals or food.</li>
                      <li>Money is abundant and freely available.</li>
                      <li>Money is durable and does not spoil or corrode.</li>
                      <li>Money has intrinsic value.</li>
                      <li>Money exists in creation and is made valuable by God.</li>
                      <li>Money functions as a medium exchange.</li>
                    </ul>
                  </blockquote>
                  Digital currencies were, of course, not anticipated by early religious scholars.
                  What is the reasoning behind limiting currencies to precious metals, and avoiding
                  more common resources?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Barker continues:
                  <blockquote>
                    His objection to sand and paper is not that they are not metal or food, but that
                    they have no intrinsic value... [value must be] determined by supply and demand,
                    and not artificially assigned by central planners.
                  </blockquote>
                  A digital currency such as Bitcoin, which derives its value from a limited supply,
                  energy acquisition costs, and global acceptance, can hold the digital equivalent of the gold standard.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Later in 2013, <a href="https://cryptoinsider.com/cryptocurrency-islamic-financial-markets/">CryptoInsider reported</a>
                  a warning from Professor Ahamed Kameel Mydin Meera, that any digital currency must be backed by a traditional currency:
                  <blockquote>
                    For a digital currency to be accepted by Islamic Finance, it needs to have a measure of value, necessarily
                    the measure of value has to be a monetary commodity. You have to put a standard weight on paper notes or electronic
                    currencies to be accepted.
                  </blockquote>
                  By "standard weight" the professor is referring to a gold dinar, based on coins that circulated in early Islamic history.
                  Entrepreneurs inspired by this argument have made at least two Sharia-compliant
                  currencies based on the price of gold (<i>see more in the Stablecoins section</i>).
                </p>
                <strong>Official rulings</strong>
                <p>
                  I've seen reports that scholars have approved
                  <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/bitcoin-islamic-law-muslims-cryptocurrency-market-permissible-sharia-news-price-surge-a8302761.html">Bitcoin<a>
                    (<a href="https://blossomfinance.com/press/is-bitcoin-halal-or-haram-a-shariah-analysis">Blossom Finance</a>),
                  <a href="https://www.xrparcade.com/news/xrp-is-sharia-compliant/">Ripple / XRP</a>,
                  and
                  <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/stellar-becomes-first-sharia-certified-blockchain-for-payments-and-asset-tokenization">Stellar</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At least two halal entrepreneurs in Dubai and Malaysia have created cryptocurrencies tied to the price of gold
                  (see later section on stablecoins).
                  <br/>
                  Other exchanges receiving Sharia rulings are
                  <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/swiss-crypto-firm-gets-islamic-finance-certification-for-sharia-compliant-stablecoin">X8, a Swiss company</a>
                  which issues tokens based on several national currencies (essentially a stablecoin),
                  <a href="https://medium.com/coinbundle/3-new-bundles-on-coinbundle-af31fbd4b038">CoinBundle</a>,
                  and Bahrain-based company <a href="https://blog.rain.bh/rain-is-sharia-compliant-13f7eba1">Rain</a>.
                </p>
                <h5>Should entrepreneurs create a halal cryptocurrency or 'fork'?</h5>
                <p>
                  The first step would be to define what makes a cryptocurrency halal.
                  Are current rulings on Bitcoin sufficient? Is there a necessary change to how the cryptocurrency is mined,
                  valued (as in the stablecoins), or spent?
                </p>
                <p>
                  If the change is that the currency is issued and regulated by a company or national bank, this move will likely
                  be seen as a method to control people's savings and transactions. Naturally people are reluctant to lose
                  control by switching currencies. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petro_(cryptocurrency)">Venezuelan 'petro'</a>
                  was seen as a desperate, controlling move and only led to awareness of Bitcoin and other unmonitored cryptocurrencies
                  (such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UwaKe9CmHGw">Dash</a>) which are accepted across borders.
                  <br/>
                  Facebook's development of Libra cryptocurrency for their platforms has raised skepticism from government and technology leaders.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If the idea is to create a currency which only an in-crowd knows about and uses
                  (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eusko">local Basque currencies</a>,
                  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Dollars">Disney dollars</a>),
                  there is a historical precedent for this motivating people. It would make sense to issue this as a new cryptocurrency or token, or fork of an existing currency.
                  If it were a fork of a popular cryptocurrency, then everyone who holds their own Bitcoin keys would start out with some of the new currency - they only need to be aware of it.
                  If someone holds Bitcoin through a managed bank or exchange, they won't have direct access.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It would be difficult to restrict who can receive cryptocurrency as payment.
                  If a market is completely closed, it could make more sense to use one central app and database instead of a cryptocurrency.
                  In a decentralized market, you might create only one official source to exchange the currency for 'real' cash or cryptocurrency,
                  but as long as it has value, others may accept it as payment or exchange it for money, similar to
                  markets for virtual currencies from popular games.

                  which are restricted to particular foods (unless people sell their credits illegally).

                <h3>What makes a cryptocurrency valuable?</h3>
                <p>
                  A cryptocurrency has value if it has scarcity and utility.<br/>
                  Depending on design, cryptocurrencies often can be mined, purchased with conventional currency, or received from other users.
                  Unlike national currencies, many cryptocurrencies can be carried across borders and used in shops worldwide.
                  Some people would like to save in a cryptocurrency instead of their local currency, or invest like they would a stock.
                </p>

                <h3>How do I get coins?</h3>
                <p>
                  There are multiple routes to obtaining cryptocurrency from the professional (large-scale computing centers running "mining" programs) to the casual (receiving money from a friend via an app). ​Because these are not physical coins, it's important to realize that they can be subdivided into more manageable fractions - for example, each one Bitcoin may be ​priced at $8,000, but you can still send a friend a small amount like $8 (0.001 BTC or 1 mBTC).
                  The smallest unit of Bitcoin is 0.00000001 (a 100-millionth of a Bitcoin, sometimes called a Satoshi),
                  but sending an amount smaller than a few dollars is discouraged through transaction fees (except potentially when using Lightning Network).
                </p>

                <h4>​Mining</h4>
                <p>
                  ​Where do Bitcoins (and other cryptocurrencies) come from?  When a cryptocurrency ​is first issued, it's unclear how it can be fairly distributed to new users. ​If a cryptocurrency were issued to everyone who registered with an email address, for example, it would be easy for scammers to create many thousands of emails and ​hoard most of the currency.
                  &nbsp;​Mining solves the distribution problem, and also the problem of decentralized information (known as the <a href="https://medium.com/coinmonks/a-note-from-anthony-if-you-havent-already-please-read-the-article-gaining-clarity-on-key-787989107969">Byzantine Generals problem</a>).
                  To build a distributed, democratic consensus, Bitcoin introduced a 'Proof of Work' which limits the amount of information to the processing power of a player on the network. ​Professional miners (and mining pools) currently have the most computing power, so their consensus has the upper hand on important decisions. Their power in mining ​also raises the difficulty for anyone mining Bitcoin - essentially it is currently unlikely that you could profit
                  by mining on a personal computer. ​In fact, professional mining operations go to great lengths to find cheap hydroelectric power in friendly jurisdictions:
                  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/19/nyregion/bitcoin-mining-new-york-electricity.html">upstate New York</a>,

                  There are reports that <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/1-cent-per-kilowatt-hour-chinas-sichuan-province-encourages-hydro-powered-bitcoin-mining/#:~:text=0-,1%20Cent%20per%20Kilowatt%2DHour%3A%20China's%20Sichuan%20Province%20Encourages%20Hydro,leverage%20the%20local%20hydropower%20plants.">excess electric power</a> is used for mining in parts of China,
                    or that the Iranian government
                    <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/iranian-president-calls-for-launching-a-cryptocurrency-mining-strategy/">supports Bitcoin mining</a>

                </p>

                <h4>Banking apps and exchanges</h4>
                <p>
                  For people without access to cryptocurrency mining technology, the simplest way ​forward is to make a purchase through an app or exchange. In most countries, ​exchanges follow the same restrictions as currency exchanges. Likely they ​will ask for a photo ID due to Know Your Customer (KYC) laws.
                  The company may decide to accept clients only from particular countries or US states (New York state being particularly restrictive), and change those rules as new laws are passed.
                  It is particularly difficult to register in international exchanges if your country is
                  <a href="https://news.bitcoin.com/bittrex-blocks-residents-north-korea-iran-crimea-syria-and-cuba/">subject to US restrictions</a>
                  (as of this writing: North Korea, Iran, Crimea, Syria, and Cuba).
                  Your bank may have rules preventing you from using a credit or debit card to make cryptocurrency purchases, especially if you are from a country which ​restricts cryptocurrency trading.
                </p>

                <h4>​Peer to Peer Payment / LocalBitcoins</h4>
                <p>
                  It's always possible to receive cryptocurrency from someone else's wallet - ​through a friend, customer, or trader. When transferring cash for cryptocurrency, ​it's essential to do research and meet in a public space to avoid being scammed! ​Take caution when carrying cash or a valuable crypto wallet on your phone, and be cautious about receiving cash
                  or trusting a message displayed on someone else's computer, phone, or website.
                  ​ Anonymous exchanges are often used when people cannot register on a bank or exchange for some reason, so fees are high and trust is important.
                  There are persistent fears that some buyers or sellers are 'sting' operations, so for everyone's comfort, do not discuss your use of cryptocurrency with your trader.
                  One of the major websites in this market is LocalBitcoins - use at your own risk.
                </p>

                <h4>​Airdrops / citizen coins</h4>
                <p>
                  During the experimental phase of cryptocurrencies and tokens, some 'citizen coins' aimed to 'airdrop' an equal amount of cryptocurrency to every resident or citizen ​of a city, region, or nation.
                  One of the more famous examples is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auroracoin">Auroracoin</a> for ​Icelanders.
                  The main challenges would be ​verifying identity, and making recipients aware of their wallets.
                  In practice, many recipients would hear about their cryptocurrency wallet and ​instead of using it as an investment or currency,
                  rushed to exchange it (for either cash or Bitcoin).
                  This spelled out a difficult start for these ​coins.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Auroracoin <a href="https://digiconomist.net/how_auroracoin_was_set_up_to_fail/">rapidly lost value</a>
                  but remains an example of citizen coins.
                </p>

                <a name="protection"></a>
                <h3>How does cryptography protect a currency?</h3>
                <p>
                  When you use a credit card, both sides trust that their bank is debiting and crediting the right accounts.
                  That trust takes a great deal of technical, organizational, and regulatory work by the bank, and when that trust fails, people
                  resort to less convenient but more immediately transferable options, such as cash, gold, or barter.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Cryptocurrency is an attempt to combine the immediate transferability of cash in your pocket, with the security and precision
                  of the modern digital world.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In fact cryptocurrency can make more secure payments by advancements in public-key cryptography.
                  Each user has a keypair with one private key (kept secret) and one public key (shared publicly) which are closely tied.
                  Alice can 'sign' a message on her phone with her private key, and anyone can verify Alice's signature with her public key.
                  By checking the blockchain, the cashier can verify Alice has enough money in her wallet to complete the transaction.
                  Alice may have a password protecting her private key, but the private key itself provides security.
                  Once a transaction is sent, it is permanently recorded in the blockchain and effectively debited from Alice's account.
