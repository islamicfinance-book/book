                <h3>Stablecoins</h3>
                <p>
                  Stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency or token with trading value pegged to the dollar, Euro, Chinese yuan, another currency, or gold.
                  Typically a stablecoin provider will show proof that it has millions (in cash or other cryptocurrencies) deposited or invested, and issue an equivalent amount of money in coins or tokens.
                  It would be silly to spend more than $1 on a dollar stablecoin, or sell it for less than $1 when the original company will match the price.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In practice, the value of stablecoins can fluctuate a few percentage points, and companies have more complex plans than 1:1 deposits.
                  Decentralized finance, or "DeFi", often involves loans and investment of stablecoin assets.
                </p>

                <h4>Who benefits from a stablecoin?</h4>
                <p>
                  One of the arguments against Bitcoin investments is that the price is too volatile.
                  A stablecoin offers technical benefits of cryptocurrency or tokens, without this uncertainty.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Haseeb Qureshi, a partner at a cryptocurrency hedge fund, calls a successful stablecoin “the Holy Grail of the cryptocurrency ecosystem”
                  <blockquote>
                    Businesses and consumers don’t want to be exposed to unnecessary currency risk when transacting in cryptocurrencies. You can’t pay someone a salary in Bitcoin if the purchasing power of their wages keeps fluctuating. Cryptocurrency volatility also precludes blockchain-based loans, derivatives, prediction markets, and other longer-term smart contracts that require price stability.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    And of course, there’s the long tail of users who don’t want to speculate. They just want a store of value on a censorship-resistant ledger, escaping the local banking system, currency controls, or a collapsing economy. Right now, Bitcoin and Ethereum can’t offer them that.
                    <br/>

                <p>
                  A USD or Chinese Yuan stablecoin may appeal to investors whose local currency is declining in value, or where they cannot easily open a bank account to receive payments and protect savings in USD.
                </p>

                <h4>Not just printing money</h4>
                <p>
                  Strategies for launching a trustworthy stablecoin revolve around technical, legal, or organizational methods to build trust in the founders keeping “real money” in their reserves:
                </p>
                <p>
                  TrustToken, the creator of TrueUSD, writes:
                  <blockquote>
                    we’ve partnered with professional third-party fiduciaries and banks, who manage access to the escrow account that holds the US dollars backing the tokens. As a TrueUSD token holder, you can redeem your TrueUSD tokens for US dollars…[you] exchange USD directly with an escrow account — we never touch the funds…
                  </blockquote>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Basis/Basecoin writes:
                  <blockquote>
                    a price-stable cryptocurrency with an algorithmic central bank… when demand is rising, the blockchain will create
                    more Basis. The expanded supply is designed to bring the Basis price back down. When demand is falling, the blockchain will buy back Basis. The contracted supply is designed to restore Basis price.
                  </blockquote>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Tether originally wrote:
                  <blockquote>
                    Every tether is always backed 1-to-1, by traditional currency held in our reserves
                  </blockquote>
                  Tether is under investigation by multiple agencies, most recently the New York Attorney General's office,
                  which <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tether-to-file-motion-with-nyag-to-dismiss-class-action-lawsuit">issued a report (disputed by Tether)</a>
                  that Bitfinex borrowed against Tether reserves and was no longer fully backed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  bitCNY and bitUSD store another cryptocurrency as their collateral:
                  <blockquote>
                    bitUSD is an asset that is not backed by real dollar in someone’s bank account. The reasons for this is trust. We cannot trust anyone to hold and secure a physical asset so that people can redeem it eventually…
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    … behind any bitUSD, there are x amount of BTS that cannot be touched, traded or otherwise moved. These BTS are locked in a smart contract and serve as collateral.

                  MakerDAO’s Dai works as a type of loan against Ethereum holdings:
                  <blockquote>
                    when Dai is worth over $1 USD, ETH holders are incentivized to create more Dai and sell it, as it’s free money.

                    <br/>
                    When Dai is worth less than $1 USD, [collateralized debt position] owners can pay down their debt at a cheaper price! source

                  In 2018, Y-Combinator backed the AnchorUSD stablecoin:

                <p>
                  Tezos is a stablecoin based on the US dollar:
                  <blockquote>
                    Assuming 100,000,000 USDtz tokens are minted, USDtez will source a $100,000,000 US dollar backing by creditors, to be used in case of a bank run. Like any loan or mortgage, this line of credit is a calculated risk by the lenders, who would need to see both another form of collateral as well as a means of income to pay interest premiums
                  </blockquote>
                  Tezos continues
                  <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bitcoin-tezos/sec-says-releasing-tezos-documents-could-hurt-enforcement-activities-idUSKBN1FT2VI">
                  legal discussions</a>
                  with the SEC and class action lawsuits.
                </p>

                <h4>How about a stablecoin for every country?</h4>
                <p>
                  Cryptocurrency is no longer a lawless “wild west”.
                  Stablecoin founders with collateral in the bank must have lawyers and business plans and headquarters in countries with financial regulations.
                  <!-- Governments have been known to set exchange rates, ban exporting their currency, and shut down private exchanges. -->
                  <!-- Cryptocurrency code may keep on running, but if the founders lose access to their bank account, or you can no longer sell your tokens for another currency, then the stability is no longer valid, and the price will collapse. -->
                </p>
                <p>
                  The United States and China are not particularly friendly to cryptocurrency, but their financial and legal systems are stable and documented well enough that founders and investors are convinced that the reward is worth the risk.
                  Over time, more countries may have established cryptocurrency regulations, and encourage innovation.
                  It's also possible that
                  <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonbrett/2019/10/26/stablecoins-are-the-new-bitcoin-in-congress/">
                    the US might treat stablecoins as securities
                  </a> in the near future.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Companies have launched stablecoins for <a href="https://coingape.com/how-can-the-merits-of-stablecoins-be-applied-in-asia/">the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore, and Hong Kong</a>.
                </p>

                <h4>Potential benefits for Stablecoins in Islamic Finance</h4>
                <p>
                  The rules of Islamic finance warn investors against uninformed contracts and speculation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It’s possible that awareness of stablecoins could convince skeptics to re-evaluate cryptocurrency as a whole.
                  People living in countries with unreliable currencies and banks could store savings in US dollars (or rials or dirhams or dinars... if their countries will allow local innovation).
                  There is no interest/riba on the account, as would be applied by a conventional-finance bank.
                  Remittance fees and currency controls could be eliminated by smart contracts. It’s possible for this to happen with fairness and transparency and without jumping onto the Bitcoin roller coaster.
                </p>

                <h4>Taxation</h4>
                <p>
                  In <a href="https://mcif.mv/laaba/">Laaba</a>, a 2018 Islamic finance publication from the Maldives,
                  Dr. Sami Al-Suwailem suggests cryptocurrency loans derived from taxing wealth (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demurrage_(currency)">demurrage, or Gesell tax</a>).
                  It is often impractical for people to find and calculate sums from various accounts, and the wealthy may use tax shelters to hide wealth.
                  In a blockchain with this enabled, every account could receive a programmed tax.
                </p>

                <h3>The Lightning Network</h3>
                <p>
                  Frustrated by Bitcoin's high fees and slow transaction times, a new 'secondary layer' of payment for Bitcoin, known as the Lightning Network,
                  is gaining popularity.
                  Two users open a channel and can send money back and forth for minimal cost.
                </p>

                <h4>A new channel for micropayments</h4>

                  In Bitcoin’s early days, entrepreneurs jumped at the opportunity to make quick transfers with low fees.
                  As the price of Bitcoin has risen, that fee has grown into a nuisance.
                </p>
                <h4>Bitcoin's micropayments problem</h4>
                <p>
                  Just as one dollar can be divided into 100 cents, a Bitcoin can be divided into 100 million “satoshis”.
                  Even at Bitcoin’s peak price at $20k, it would take 50 satoshis to make one cent.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Entrepreneurs have started about using these small amounts of Bitcoin, for example, offering video creators $0.01 per view,
                  traceable donations for school supplies, etc. But in the blockchain, tiny transactions are usually ignored unless they
                  provide a fee to miners. For example as of this writing, my wallet app refuses to send amounts less than 4 cents, and
                  charges typically 10 to 78 cents per transaction.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lightning Network made it possible for me to send multiple Bitcoin transactions smaller than a cent, almost instantaneously.
                </p>
                <h4>What is Lightning Network?</h4>
                <p>
                  In January 2016, the Lightning Network was introduced via a white paper post.
                  In 2017 Lightning reached an alpha release, and in 2018 the protocol became available on Bitcoin and Litecoin networks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To start a transaction, you connect with another peer in the Lightning Network, and open a channel where both sides can move money back and forth, with transactions big and small.
                  It’s represented on the blockchain as a shared wallet. When you’re done paying, you close the connection and use that information to send a final one-transaction summary to the Bitcoin blockchain.
                </p>
                <h4>Making payments</h4>
                <p>
                  Here’s how you pay someone in Lightning for the first time:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Find an interesting, Lightning-enabled site</li>
                    <li>Install a wallet app which supports Lightning payments</li>
                    <li>Transfer > $20 of Bitcoin into the wallet. You will need this initial funding to open a channel, even for microtransactions.</li>
                    <li>Use the site’s prompts to open up a QR code. The wallet can scan this code, and should ask to open up a payment channel between you and the site.</li>
                    <li>You pay a 3–5 cent fee to open your channel, and make sure some money is available in it.</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The channel needs multiple confirmations before it can be used. This can take 30 minutes.
                  Ideally you mutually close the channel and have your final payout returned immediately, but I unilaterally closed, increasing the fee and
                  making me wait for the end of a 24 hour window.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Here’s where it gets controversial: many users believe in Bitcoin as decentralized money, and there’s a fear that the Lightning Network might re-centralize payments.
                  Suppose instead of opening a new channel to every person and store I interact with, my wallet would use only one channel to my bank, my grocer would have channels to their bank and their payroll, and banks would continue to charge fees
                  and control transactions as intermediaries.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It’s a little clunky to get started, but expect Lightning Network to continue evolving, lowering fees, and changing day-to-day use of Bitcoin.

                <h3>zkSnarks</h3>
                <p>
                  ​zkSnarks are a type of smart contract introduced by ZCash and slowly being ​incorporated
                  <a href="https://hackernoon.com/ethereum-support-for-zk-snarks-ce103bd6ac89">into Ethereum</a>.
                  Rather than a publicly interpretable contract with globally-known state, a snark uses homomorphic encryption for miners to ​calculate results,
                  without knowing the unencryted meaning.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In these early stages, ​zkSnarks are usually simple, and their gas prices are significantly higher than a public contract,
                  but there is widespread interest in developing this technology further.
