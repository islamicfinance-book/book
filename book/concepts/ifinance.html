                <h2>Intro to Islamic Finance</h2>
                <p>
                  The objective of this book is to close the gaps between conventional finance, cryptocurrency technology, and Islamic finance.
                  For a full picture, it's necessary to give a baseline knowledge of Islamic finance as it's practiced today. This book cannot be authoritative on the matter, and I encourage you to read more through more sources.
                  As I mention in the introduction,
                  not all Muslims participate in Islamic finance (adoption varies by region and by personal beliefs),
                  and participation is not limited to Muslim customers or investors.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There's a large glossary of terms at: <a href="https://www.islamic-banking.com/explore/glossary/glossary-financial-terms">islamic-banking.com</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The fundamental distinction of Islamic finance is that riba (interest), gharar (speculation), and non-halal businesses (pork, alcohol, gambling) are forbidden.
                  These are not simply terms to avoid; these concepts are well-defined and must be separated from any Sharia-compliant contract.
                  This system does not prevent a business from having revenues and losses and profits,
                  but provides an alternative to conventional financial lenders.
                </p>
                <p>
                  How can a bank without interest lend money and attract investors? How do we talk about opportunity cost and risk?
                  Virtually every topic in the Islamic Finance field can be traced back to contracts and to this challenge of incentives.
                </p>
                <h4>Types of Contracts</h4>
                <p>
                  Categories of contracts include: takaful (insurance) - sukuk (bonds) - salam (forward sale for farmers) - mudarabah/musharakah (profit-sharing) - Qard al-Hasan (benevolent loans), and many more.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On the national scale, sukuk has been used much the same as bonds in other countries. The country tends to give the investors a stake on natural resources or a new infrastructure development (tied to the reasons for collecting the sukuk).
                </p>
                <p>
                  For investments in larger businesses, a mudarabah / musharakah agreement shares the profit or loss of an investment, with the bank
                  adjusting the share percentage once the business becomes profitable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For smaller, microfinance-scale loans, an Islamic bank is tasked with building a contract which can be repaid on time.
                  Interest is forbidden, so profits are based on fees. Each loan is based on trust -Â  an irresponsible borrower will not be allowed to continue borrowing.
                  Building that trust in person is an artform. For digital banking, that trust requires a strong identity system, to prevent the borrower from buying
                  a new SIM card or re-installing an app to apply for a new loan.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Islamic finance methods have been applied and fit into newer economic practices, including
                    <a href="https://www.digitalnewsasia.com/digital-economy/ethis-ventures-receives-malaysias-first-islamic-ecf-license">crowdfunding</a>
                    and <a href="https://journal.wahedinvest.com/the-impact-of-financial-technology/">retirement investments</a>.
                </p>

                <a name="risk"></a>
                <h3>Risks for Islamic Finance and Cryptocurrency</h3>
                <p>
                  Decentralized cryptocurrencies raise concerns for Islamic finance institutions:
                  <ul>
                    <li>banks should not place customers' deposits into a speculative cryptocurrency</li>
                    <li>a reliable identity system is needed to build trust that a customer will pay fees and return their loan on time</li>
                    <li>unlike <a href="https://musliminc.com/i-bet-you-dint-know-about-halal-credit-cards-8233">Shariah-compliant credit cards</a>, cryptocurrency payments cannot be restricted; even if they know their customer's account, usually they cannot identify who the customer is paying</li>
                    <li>the institution's Sharia review board may not approve cryptocurrency projects out of an abundance of caution</li>
                  </ul>
                  An open question is whether the benefits of cryptocurrency - transparent smart contracts, fast international payments, and
                  automated accounting - will encourage institutions to adopt cryptocurrency for some clinets and properly mitigate their risks.
                </p>

                <h3>Sharia Risk</h3>
                <p>
                  In any investment, lenders map out the risks and categorize them. For example when buying a house, you assume the risk of the house being damaged in a flood, or on a macro-scale, the housing market suffering and being unable to profitable resell.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Islamic finance investments additionally carry the Sharia risk of being discredited and invalidated by an Islamic finance authority. These decisions can come through Sharia review board rulings or through local government regulation.
                  Some practices are considered Sharia-compliant/halal in one country but not another, on the basis of interpretations and compliance with conventional finance systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Fearing new regulation is nothing new, but the added uncertainty and inflexibility of religious regulation makes institutions less likely to innovate or experiment with new structures.
                  A cryptocurrency program should take care to re-implement existing structures, and improve on them in marginal ways, rather than marketing an untested system like the DAO, or a new currency.
                </p>

                <a name="regulation"></a>
                <h3>Role of Government Regulation</h3>
                <p>
                  A consistent threat in both the Islamic Finance and cryptocurrency worlds is government regulation.
                  Countries allow or forbid Islamic banking not solely based on whether there are local Muslim communities,
                  but whether those countries <a href="http://www.financialislam.com/relationship-with-central-banks.html">have reviewed financial regulations</a> and allowed Islamic banks to create and implement
                  their specialized contracts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One of the best global guides to cryptocurrency legality (as of 2019) is <a href="https://www.loc.gov/law/help/cryptocurrency/world-survey.php">the Library of Congress</a>.
                  For Islamic finance, see <a href="http://www.gifr.net/publications/gifr2019/ifci.pdf">the Global Islamic Finance Report (PDF)</a>.
                  <br/>
                  <em>As a broad generalization - not legal or tax advice - </em>, when regulation is unclear, Islamic finance institutions will follow rules for a conventional bank,
                  and cryptocurrency exchanges are treated as a foreign currency exchange, and individual traders are treated (and taxed!) as commodity traders.
                </p>
                <h4>India</h4>
                <p>
                  In India, the national legislature and central bank (RBI), have consistently
                  prevented Islamic banks, and "Islamic windows" (a specialized department within a conventional bank)
                  from operating freely.
                  <br/>
                  Cryptocurrencies and exchanges have been operating in a legal grey area for years.
                  <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/supreme-court-sets-aside-rbi-ban-on-cryptocurrency-transactions/article30979301.ece">In 2018 and 2019</a>,
                    officials claimed or recommended that cryptocurrency trading should be banned
                   and exchanges closed, except for a potential future for a national centralized cryptocurrency.
                   <br/>
                   In March 2020, the Supreme Court removed the RBI ban, theoretically giving
                   <a href="https://cis-india.org/internet-governance/blog/cryptocurrencies-in-india-get-a-second-wind">"a second wind"</a>
                   to local users, but it's the future of the industry remains unclear.
                </p>
                <h4>China</h4>
                <p>
                  Recently a university in China
                  <a href="https://twitter.com/FintechHiveDIFC/status/1153252996865822720">began a program in Islamic finance studies</a>;
                  but local regulation <a href="http://www.ijmar.org/v6n1/19-002.html">does nothing</a> to support the industry inside of China.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Chinese government has banned Bitcoin exchanges, but it is still a popular investment
                  and <a href="https://twitter.com/Excellion/status/1154985452127916032">discussed</a> by the Bank of China.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Other companies continue to research and focus on blockchain technologies
                  such as Ethereum smart contracts.
                  There is also a <a href="https://twitter.com/katherineykwu/status/1188833254402613250">state-backed stablecoin, DC/EP</a>
                </p>

                <h4>Japan</h4>
                <p>
                  As of 2019, sukuk (Islamic bonds) have made <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/MUFG-prepares-to-offer-Islamic-bonds-in-Japan">small inroads</a> in Japan
                  through Malaysian banks.
                </p>

                <h4>Dubai</h4>
                <p>
                  Dubai is well-known for having tech incubators (including for blockchain).
                  The <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/309651">Goodforce Labs incubator</a> supports Islamic finance
                  and social good businesses in a Dubai free trade zone.
                  There are plans for an eCommerce free trade zone.
                </p>

                <h4>North Korea, Venezuela, Iran, and Cuba</h4>
                <p>
                  As longtime focii of US sanctions, North Korea, Venezuela, Iran, and Cuba have an unusual relationship to cryptocurrency and conventional finance.
                  In the past few years, each country has announced serious interest in developing their own cryptocurrency,
                  with Venezuela releasing the Petro based on national oil wealth.

                  Singapore is one of Asia's financial hubs, so it's moved quickly to regulate how cryptocurrency businesses
                  are licensed, and how cryptocurrency holders are taxed.

                <p>
                  Though recognized by few other countries, Hargeisa has served as the capital of an autonomous Somaliland government for decades.

                <h3>Islamic Microfinance</h3>
                <p>
                  Microfinance is an emerging topic in the Islamic finance industry. Many developing nations have practicing Muslim populations and communities, and the benefits of microfinance-scale loans has been researched intensively for decades now.
                  According to Gates Foundation research in Pakistan and Bangladesh, one obstacle toward scaling up microfinance was that the practices were based on lending and high interest rates, which potential recipients rejected as not halal.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The microfinance community must meet this challenge by innovating on their practices and experimenting with different contracts.
                  This may be a potential inroad for cryptocurrency because the blockchain can enable payments across borders, serve as a bank account, and add transparency to donor/investor portfolios.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There is now a concept of
                  <a href="https://medium.com/world-economic-forum/move-over-microfinance-heres-why-the-future-of-development-is-in-nanofinance-fa8804499ee8">"nanofinance"</a>
                  where outside investors will help with even small improving purchases.
                  These could be financed by individuals on the blockchain, either within a community or halfway around the world (similar to how someone could trace coffee beans to the source).
