                <a name="practicality"></a>
                <h3>​Practicality</h3>
                <p>
                  ​coindesk.com/whats-holding-back-bitcoin-in-venezuela-this-group-is-investigating
                  The cryptocurrency world remains foreign and inaccessible to most people of the world, when you take into account technical literacy, internet connectivity, language barriers, and general availability.
                  For a cross-border currency, it is ​much easier to find places that accept and exchange US dollars, British pounds, or Euros than it is to find reliable Bitcoin exchanges.
                </p>
                <p>
                  ​In countries where the local currency is failing - Venezuelan bolivar - cryptocurrency holds a major advantage and protects savings.
                  The ^^ org is ​researching how holders of Bitcoin and Dash (another cryptocurrency) are ​operating in this situation and trading with Colombia and receiving donations.
                  The situation is complicated by Venezuela's introduction of an official petro-cryptocurrency, which US people are banned from trading (include?).
                </p>
                <p>
                  In any case, it's only a minority of Venezuelans who have adopted cryptocurrency. https://twitter.com/nickspanos/status/1137845937441841154
                </p>

                <a name="reverse"></a>
                <h3>​Irreversible</h3>
                <p>
                  Credit card customers can challenge fraudulent charges. A crypto system cannot do this.
                </p>


                <a name="security"></a>
                <h3>Security and Theft</h3>
                <p>
                  ​The Bitcoin protocol has strong cryptographic security, but in practice most ​users depend on apps and exchanges to hold their cryptocurrency.
                  If I keep ​my money on an insecure or fraudulent exchange, it could be hacked and the ​money redirected elsewhere.
                </p>
                <p>
                  ​In the fiat world, many bank accounts are insured (in the US, FDIC).
                  Insurance is affordable because banks and financial crimes investigators can ​track where the money was sent, who received it, etc.
                  There are cases where sophisticated hackers succeeded (Bangladesh SWIFT) but overall there is a system of safety and accountability to the point that I don't expect a loss or interruption from hacks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One mitigation technique is to put Bitcoin into 'cold storage', with the keys to this 'cold wallet' kept offline or even in safety-deposit boxes.
                  Major exchanges will allow you to split ​and move cryptocurrency between the 'hot' and 'cold' wallets.
                  The 'cold wallet' ​system does not protect you from fraud, major flaws in the security system, or from a sophisticated hacker who convinces an exchange to release money from cold storage.
                </p>
                <p>
                  ​When a major exchange is hacked (for example, Mt. Gox), investors in and outside ​of that exchange suffer a loss of confidence, and the price of a currency may fall.
                </p>

                <h4>​Tainted Coins</h4>
                <p>
                  For years, one potential solution to the theft problem has inspired discussions about a public blacklist of stolen coins.
                  Theft and fraud would still be possible, but the thieves would find no safe harbor willing to take their money (without being blocked themselves).
                  On a less technical side, the early response to the DAO attack, Ethereum contacted many exchanges to block exchanging Ether for currency.
                </p>
                <p>​
                  The blockchain makes this level of tracing possible. In practice, we run into
                  <ul>
                    <li>tumblers: A modern form of money laundering - mixers on the dark web send your dirty money through tons of transactions and output money from other sources to your new address, minus a fee. This works only for smaller amounts of stolen currency, as a large amount (say 100ks to millions) would overwhelm the system and you'd be getting back the same coins that you put in.</li>
                    <li>unwitting accomplices: how would you feel if you received ​cryptocurrency fairly, and then were asked to prove that you didn't steal it? ​As money moves from address to address, it's usually not possible to say when ​it is being moved around by an individual, a mixer, or part of the regular economy.</li>
                    <li>centralization: the only way to give all individuals, exchanges, and apps a fair chance at blocking stolen coins, would be to create a centralized blacklist. This discussion runs opposed to most cryptocurrency early adopters, so blacklisting is highly controversial and potentially transformative for the crypto world.</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>

                <h4>Quantum Safety</h4>
                https://twitter.com/DoveyWan/status/1192186523740856320
                <p>
                  A handful of companies are working on the first consumer-ready quantum computers.
                  With technical methods beyond the scope of this book, quantum computers can take advantage of natural physical effects to perform some calculations much faster than today's supercomputers ever could using transistors.
                  A universal quantum computer with thousands of entangled practical (not physical) qubits could break our most common encryption algorithms, including those used on the internet and in most cryptocurrencies.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The current record as of this writing is still under 100 superconducting qubits, but the future is within sight.
                  Dr. Michele Mosca estimates a 1/7 chance of breaking RSA cryptography by 2026, and 1/2 chance by 2031.
                  https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/1075.pdf
                </p>
                <p>
                  For Bitcoin transactions, a high-powered quantum computer could use the public key signature used to verify an outgoing transaction, to find the private key used to sign that transaction.
                  This problem could be temporarily circumvented by always abandoning the old address after making a transaction (as discussed in blockchain transparency - sending your transaction and moving the change to a new address).
                  The oldest Bitcoin accounts (including Satoshi's) shared more information about their public keys, so these would be more vulnerable to quantum hackers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The post-quantum solution is still unclear (switching encryption algorithms? disabling keys from old accounts?).
                  The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is working towards a more clear global standard.
                  Several altcoins have adopted existing post-quantum algorithms as a selling point, but none are commonly used as of this writing.

                <h3>51% Attacks</h3>
                <p>
                  From the earlier section on Mining, you know that many different organizations and individuals are running cryptocurrency miners, and some are combining their efforts into 'mining pools'.
                  With small cryptocurrencies, and in rare cases with Bitcoin or others, a single user or pool may control the majority of mining computation power at one time.
                  If the 51%er is malicious, they could use their control to allow invalid transactions / double spending / or split the blockchain into two.

                  The website <a href="https://www.crypto51.app/">Crypto51.app</a> estimates the cost of a 51% attack on several different blockchains.

                  In Bitcoin's case, estimate that computation of a 51% attack would cost $$$ and would not be worthwhile.

                <a name="energy"></a>
                <h3>​Energy costs</h3>
                <p>
                  Energy costs are mentioned in blockchain critism usually in three different contexts:
                  <ul>
                    <li>scalability: with the current network being relatively small, how can it scale up to support the global payment system?</li>
                    <li>environmentalism: energy consumption by cryptocurrency  miners may be seen as wasteful, and if it keeps increasing, may have a negative impact on the environment</li>
                    <li>cost: if Bitcoin consumes resources, how can it have value? This argument has puzzled for me for years. Golf courses consume huge resources in land and water, and we aren’t devaluing them, are we? I'd argue that energy consumption is one of the reasons why a digital currency can have real value and scarcity.</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <h4>Statistics and solutions</h4>
                https://techxplore.com/news/2019-07-bitcoin-index-energy-consumption.html

                <p>
                  Over the past few years, the amount of energy used by cryptocurrency miners has gone from 'surprising' to 'maybe deeply affecting climate change'.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At Bitcoin’s peak prices, reports following its exponential growth claimed that it was :
                  <blockquote>
                    By July 2019, the bitcoin network will require more electricity than the entire United States currently uses. By February 2020, it will use as much electricity as the entire world does today. — https://grist.org/article/bitcoin-could-cost-us-our-clean-energy-future/
                  </blockquote>
                  A later article claimed that Bitcoin mining had reversed the effects of energy efficiency movements across Europe.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As of this writing in mid-2019, Bitcoin's energy consumption is not comparable to the United States. This isn't due to a drop in interest, either - there are more miners with a higher hash rate than ever before. The
                  problem is estimating these energy costs, which is best done with the Oxford study [TODO]
                </p>
                <h4>Replacing Proof of Work</h4>
                <p>
                  Ethereum and other cryptocurrencies are considering shifting to “Proof of Stake” to replace “Proof of Work”, the basis of consensus in most public blockchains today. The Ethereum FAQ page appeared in September 2016, and progress is coming along slowly.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Luckily, Ethereum has clear founders and a relatively healthy process for accepting code changes. On the other side, Bitcoin has forked in the past over technical decisions, and would fork again if changes were made to  Proof of Work.

                <h4>Bitcoin for global clean energy</h4>
                <p>
                  One of the pro-Bitcoin takes which I’ve seen on this came from “Bitcoin and meat maximalist” and Nakamoto Institute president Michael Goldstein, who is more known for his quotes describing plants as “fiat food”.

                  Bitcoin mining will also incentivize an energy arms race, which will result in magnificent innovation in energy production, through nuclear power and other clean energies. Bitcoin miners do not want a single joule to go to waste.

                  Let’s see what he means by that (these are from separate but related Twitter threads also in late 2017).
                  These types of changes require huge capital investments, R&D, and construction time which take significant time.
                  As of July 2017, there were only two new nuclear power plants under construction in the United States:

                  So as interesting as this Bitcoin-backed pro-energy future might be, I don’t see how it can come quickly enough to offset near-future costs.

                <h4>Private Blockchains</h4>
                <p>
                  From another angle, IBM’s blockchain division acknowledges Bitcoin is unsustainable, and appears to advocate for private blockchain solutions, where you don’t have the competition and Proof of Work requirements of a public blockchain.
                </p>
                <h4>Looking forward</h4>
                <p>
                  When I first heard the energy-consumption argument in early 2014, an economics professor urged me to get out of Bitcoin.
                  The argument then was that Bitcoin consumed so much power, that it couldn’t be worthwhile to use and mine.

                  I asked that if golf courses use so many resources (power, water, land) does that make them have no value? Clearly not.
                  In a world with ruthless efficiency, no one would build a golf course.
                  In a world with absolute trust, we could use private databases and private blockchains without concern.
                  In a capitalist society, we are incentivized to make both.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I believe that public blockchains have an unmatchable ability to solve problems in banking and identity.
                  There are projects to give ID cards to refugees and migrant workers, where no one country could claim authority and take responsibility for them.
                  There are transactions happening across borders which were not otherwise possible (I know this from personal experience).
                  There are people today paying high fees to have a savings account or with no financial records at all, who use cryptocurrency-capable phones.
                  Smart contracts could make a real difference in transparent charitable giving, and reliability and efficiency of financial institutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Even when cryptocurrency users are aware of efficiency and power consumption issues, the feeling is that someone in leadership will take care of it.
                  In the past few months I’ve seen pitches for cryptocurrencies as a financial incentive for recycling or home solar panels, without analysis of whether the micropayments cost more.
                  There are ideas for technical solutions, there are ideas for IRL construction.
                  Beyond individual investors, is there a cryptocurrency fund for the community to support sustainable energy?
                  Is there a bounty or marketplace for cryptocurrency developers to explore alternatives to Proof of Work?
                  If cryptocurrency-hodlers don’t like being vilified and contributing to environmental destruction, the solutions need to come from within.
                  What’s our best shot at changing the world for the better?

                <h4>The DAO</h4>
                <p>
                  As mentioned several times earlier, the DAO was an experiment in crowdfunding for venture capital.
                  For many participants it was their first time using a smart contract, and the several steps toward adopting it were frustrating.
                  The DAO had a fatal flaw which allowed an outside contract (even though it hadn't been approved) to siphon money from the investment account.
                  This revealed that contracts work as they are programmed, not how we might want them to work.

                <h4>Augur</h4>
                <p>
                  Augur is a prediction market which uses cryptocurrency and allows a variety of predictions (sports, politics, etc).
                  The blockchain has no way to verify the outcome of events in the real world, so the winning outcome is determined by a creator of the contract.
                  There are also concerns about a fully open prediction market being used to encourage or speculate on political violence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In one newsworthy case, a prediction market for 'who will control US congress after 2018 elections' initially posted that the Republican party still controlled the House the next day,
                  rather than the more rational reading (which party would win the elections and have control after inauguration of the newly elected Congress in January 2019).
                  This was disputed and resolved.

                <h3>Stablecoins</h3>
                <p>
                  The most notable criticism of stablecoins that I've heard, is how governments have spent many years trying to 'peg' their currency to a fixed rate on the dollar, and every time they have met with failure.
                  With decentralization, it is always possible for third parties to open exchanges, and financiers will want to speculate and make a profit through arbitrage.
                  Are stablecoins capable of doing things differently?
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another obvious critique of stablecoins is that they seem unprofitable.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The benefit to Facebook or another org for opening up a stablecoin market, is the same reason that stores like to issue gift certificates or 'Disney dollars', and arcades convert your money into tokens
                  - they can receive standard money now and know that users will continue to make purchases within their market, with either a 'sunk cost' philosophy or a cognitive space between the value of the dollar and the value of their 'coin'.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Personally I think that stablecoins could introduce more customers to cryptocurrencies and tokens, calm fears
                  about price volatility, and then make it possible to sell new cryptocurrencies and services to that userbase.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A final criticism of stablecoins is, even accepting the arcade tokens / Disney dollars deal, what is the point of offering them on a blockchain, instead of a central database?
                  The latter would likely be a better option for internal control, stability, and lower transaction fees.
                  In avoiding a controlled bank, Facebook and other stablecoin mints clearly expect a wider ecosystem of stores and suppliers.
